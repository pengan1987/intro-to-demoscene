# What is Demoscene?

This is the first course in China that introduces the "Demoscene" as a digital cultural phenomenon from the perspective of humanities and social sciences.

## What is the scene?
In this class, I would like to introduce you to the longest running digital cultural phenomenon that has had a considerable impact around the world: the Demoscene, that is, the demo scene.

First of all, let's talk about why it is called Demoscene, and then look at what it is, then we generally look at its name, in fact, is a synthetic word, is the demo scene, then what is a scene? The explanation is this: scene

> a particular area of activity and all the people or things connected with it.
> a particular area of activity and all the people or things connected with it.

Then look at the Collins dictionary again: https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/scene

> You can refer to an area of activity as a particular type of scene.
> You can refer to an area of activity as a particular type of scene.

The word "scene" is actually a rather simple and crude translation; there is no equivalent in modern Chinese. However, this is not the first time the term has been used, as many subcultures have been using it, such as the "underground music scene" or "punk scene" or "rock scene", and so on, perhaps As time goes by, mainstream Chinese will gradually accept this meaning of "scene" as well.

For now, in more authentic Chinese, a "scene" is probably a circle or community of fans, for example, "underground music scene" would be more obscure, while "underground music circle "is very easy to understand. Therefore, a more localized name for the "demo scene" might be "demo circle" or "demo circle". However, because this cultural phenomenon of demo production has not been widely seen in the Chinese community, including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, there has not been a fixed translation, and very often he is directly called Demoscene without translation. "I think it's a bit too simplified and does not reach the meaning.

So what is a demo? According to the definition on Wikipedia, a demo is.

> self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audiovisual presentations.
> self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audiovisual presentations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene

So the Demoscene thing is really a community of hobbyists who make the kind of computer programs described above.

So let's take a look at some Demos, and we'll see that these demos probably meet several characteristics.

1. Self-contained, they are self-contained and do not require an external player. 2.
2. Executable, it is an executable program. 3.
3. Real-time, they are generated in real time using a computer, not pre-rendered CG animation. Therefore they will obviously be affected and limited by the running platform, for example, running demos developed in recent years on old computers may be very slow or not work. CG animations, on the other hand, can spend hundreds of times the playback time pre-rendered and are less constrained by hardware performance.
4. Audio-Visual, their main form of expression is a combination of visual effects and auditory effects.
5. Non-interactive, that is, non-interactive, the whole process of watching the demo it usually does not need to operate, or only use a single button to switch the effect, which is the most obvious difference between it and the game, compared to the game emphasis on interaction, the developer will be carefully designed in the gameplay, but the demo does not consider this, although the demo and the game share a lot of technology, but and the game is a different form of work.

## Demo and platform
The connection between games and the hardware and software platforms on which they run is quite strong, with games showing considerable variation across different models of consoles, cell phones or and computers. Similarly to games, demos have a similarly strong connection to hardware. demos are also found on almost every PC platform, be it Commodore 64, MS-DOS, Amiga or ZX Spectrum, there are demos for every PC platform imaginable.

On the Internet Archive we can find many demo works and run them with the online emulator it provides. We will find a clear difference between the audio and visual effects of demos running under DOS and those developed for modern computers. Let's then look at the demo on the Commodore 64.

A DOS demo that works on the Internet Archive, Unreal: https://archive.org/details/unreal_zip

A Commodore 64 demo on the Internet Archive, Soiled Legacy: https://archive.org/details/Soiled_Legacy_2001_Resource_Side_A

We will find some similarities between the demo on the Commodore 64 and the DOS demo, such as the rotating cube, the light bar banner across the screen, and so on. But we can also see some unique styles that make the Commodore 64 different from the PC, as it is an 8-bit model, so we can see the pixelated graphics and low color palette typical of the eight-bit platform. Its music style also resembles that of older consoles. The DOS running on the 16-bit X86 platform, on the other hand, will have richer colors and music composed of recorded samples and other elements that show the capabilities of a 16-bit computer. And demos for contemporary computers will show brilliant true color graphics and 3D effects. All of this reflects the close connection between the performance of the computer hardware and the presentation style of the demo.

## Size-coding: volume-oriented programming
If we investigate some demos, we will find that some demos are very small in size, many of them are only 60KB or less than 64KB, and in some Chinese communities, the concept of "64k animation" is also mentioned. The term "64K animation" is a rather out-of-context description of a unique practice in Demoscene, where demos are not an "animation" but an executable program. The exact description of this practice should be called "size-coding", i.e. volume-oriented programming, which has many kinds of capacity limits, such as 256byte, 1KB, 4KB, 64KB, etc. The size-coding in Demoscene basically works in several directions to reduce the capacity of the program.

The first thing is to use the program to do the generation, for example, we just saw a large number of cubic bricks in the demo, in which the large bricks inside the small bricks, this is a typical fractal pattern, only need to use a formula or use several formulas to generate layers of nested graphics, fractal image and its variants is the most typical scene of the program generation.

Another thing is the reuse of materials, which is similar to the development techniques used on old video games, such as using a single 3D modeling with different mapping to "play" different objects, or using a single texture dyed with different colors to simulate different surfaces, for example, a red "fruit skin For example, a red "fruit skin" dyed green becomes a "leaf", through the repeated use of materials, then the program can be smaller.

The last case is that it will do the compression of the program code, many programs take a long time to load, the first thing it has to do is to unpack the program. Then it "warms up" and generates all kinds of material to put in memory to keep it running fast. Many times a demo that takes up only 64KB on the hard drive can require hundreds of megabytes of memory.

Size-coding often involves a lot of assembly code and requires a foundation in computer science and an understanding of hardware. Because this class is biased towards the humanities, we will not look too deeply into its implementation. However, the influence of size-coding practices in Demoscene is very common. If you are interested in some of the technical details of size-coding, the wiki provided at sizecoding.org is a great place to find tips for small volume programming on a variety of different platforms.

## Where to find Scene?
Next I'll talk about where to find Demoscene related content. There is no active demo scene in China anymore, and the best way to understand the status and dynamics of Demoscene in China is through the website. The demoscene.info website has a collection of websites related to the demo scene, and its navigation bar divides these websites into several categories.

Forum is the forum, for example Pouet.net is one of the most prosperous forums in the demo scene at the moment, basically all news about demos, big and small, appear in it, whether it is a release of a work, a preview of an event or other activities will appear in the forum

Demoparties is a category that collects all kinds of "demo parties", just like there are concerts or concerts in various underground music scenes, participants in the demo scene will also showcase and communicate through parties. Among the parties listed on the site, Assembly is held in Helsinki, Finland; BreakPoint is in Bingen am Rhein, Germany; and Evoke is a German demo party held in Cologne. demoscene.info is a bit old, and some parties have been discontinued, such as the last Breakpoint held in 2010

Demogroups is a collection of websites of demo teams, like bands, where demo enthusiasts also create groups.

The Music category is a collection of websites focused on music creation in the demo scene, and from these websites collected on demoscene.info, we can get a general overview of the demo scene.

Another portal to explore the demo scene community is scene.org, which has a very important feature called Scene ID, a unified login system shared by many demo scene websites, allowing access to many demo scene websites with a single login: SCENE.ORG

In addition to Pouet.net, another important website that can be accessed with Scene ID is demoparty.net, a website dedicated to collecting information about demo parties around the world. The best way to get up close to the demo scene community is to go to a demo party, and demoparty.net is the site that helps people find the parties they want to attend.

At demoparty.net we can find a series of future parties that will start, and we can see not only the general information about the time and place of the party, but also the welcome demos made by the organizers and participants of the demo scene, such as the Revision 2022 party held in April this year: https://www. demoparty.net/revision/revision-2022

Hobbyists have created several welcome demos for different platforms, including Commodore 64, Gameboy, Amiga, PC, and TIC-80, a fictional console platform (Fantasy Console). This is a unique habit in the demo scene, after all, there is nothing better than a demo program itself as an "electronic invitation" to other community members.

The Revision Party is the most influential demo party in Germany, and the enthusiasm and strength of the community can be seen in the fact that many people have already brought out their work to welcome other participants during the welcome session before the party starts.

## Demo Parties
And let's look at what kind of activities will take place at a demo party. Generally speaking, there will be workshops, lectures, concerts, party coding, which means programming in a conference room, and the most exciting part: the compo, which is a competition.

So let's take Revision 2022 as an example and see how the demo party is organized.

On the Revision Party homepage, you can see some basic information about the party, such as the way to participate both online and on-site, the fact that the party is free of charge, and the fact that participants are welcome to submit their work.

The first important deadline is Friday and Saturday at 6:00 pm, which is the deadline for the submission of different types of works. Some of the other time points are Events, which are live events, such as opening night, competition presentations, etc. Another type of time point is Seminar, which is a lecture. The first lecture is usually an overview of the Demoscene to first-time attendees of the demo party, just like the one in this class. Of course, the Concert is also a popular part of the Demo Party, usually playing music written by the demo makers themselves, and in many cases, chip music.

The most exciting and intense part of a demo party is a series of compo, or competitions, such as Tracker Music, a limited production technique that uses track sequencers to create music competitions; ASCII Art competitions, which use characters to create graphics; Oldschool music compo, which uses old computers to create music competitions, and PC 64k compo, which is a competition that uses old computers to create music. and the PC 64k compo, which is a contest for size-coding demos with a 64k cap as mentioned earlier, etc.

Another important category of information in demoparty.net is the entries and awards from previous gatherings. For example, if we open the page of last year's Revision 2021 Online gathering, we will see the detailed competition terms and the number of votes received: Results for Revision 2021 Online

For example, in the PC demo category, the first place was 1810 votes, the second place was 1702 votes, the third place was 1701 votes, etc. The first Revision Party was held in 2011 and has a history of 11 years. Other parties, such as the Assembly Party in Finland, had their first one in 1992, which is 30 years old, and the results of each of them can be found on the website.

The Demoscene community's archive is also very complete, so we can see not only the results of the 1992 competition, but also the works that were made at that time, such as the winning PC demo of the 1992 Assembly Party, Unreal, which can be downloaded as an executable program, can be seen on Youtube, and is available in the Internet There are also emulators available in the Internet Archive. The team that developed this program, Future Crew, later became Futuremark, the developer of the PC benchmark tests 3D Mark and PC Mark, and the core members of Finnish game developer Remedy are also from this team. There are many similar examples in other Nordic countries, and the connection and communication between the Nordic demo scene and people in the game industry is quite close.

## Division of labor among the participants
So what kind of participants will the team developing the demo have? We can find the list of demo authors inside the demozoo website, as well as the list of Demogroup's team members. From these lists, we can see several identities of demo producers: one is code, which is a programmer; then graphic, which is a graphic designer; and then music, which is a music producer. Although there are occasionally demos completed by a single person, most demos are a combination of participants with different specialties working together.

Most of the current demo teams are active in Europe. If we look at the countries where demos are held on demoparty.net, we will see that there are basically all European countries, then the United States and Canada in North America, Argentina and Brazil in South America, and Australia as well, but basically only Japan in Asia, and Turkey in the immediate vicinity of Europe, and since most of the participants are from Europe, sometimes Demoscene is also known as euro-demo, or "European demo".

The demo scene was briefly present in China in the 2000s, when the sycini.com site was the largest and most active of the domestic community. But the site was shut down in 2008, and only a glimpse of it can be found in the Internet archives. I personally owned the domain for a short time, but then did not renew it.

Similar to the overseas demo scene, this site's was also created by enthusiasts. Its two founders, summ0 and yxh, were both students at Renmin University of China's School of Arts at the time, and because the founders were from art majors, the Sycini team also worked with Beijing's Santuo Flag drama club, but the two founders actually didn't have the energy to run the community after graduation, and the domestic demo scene went silent. I tried to contact the participants of Sycini at that time after 2017, and managed to get in touch with dword, Wacker and other members, but the two founders were never contacted. I have also tried to collect the works currently scattered around the web and fixed the download links for some of them on Pouet.net, but some of them still could not be found.

Why is ## Demoscene so important?
Next, let's look at why Demoscene is such a big deal at this point in time, with a course topic. Among the several important features of Demoscene that we just mentioned, one of them is that all of its works are digitally native, programs that can be executed on a computer, and it provides an important frame of reference for other types of digital artworks. The second thing is that it has existed in popular culture for a long time, traversing several major changes in the social environment and technological conditions, as we have just seen in our search for Assembly Party from 1992, and earlier works dating back to the late 1970s.

The third point, which is also very useful for conducting research, is that Demoscene has one of the most complete and organized repositories of digital primary works to date. In the archives of scene.org and demozoo.org, we can find not only thousands of works spanning more than 40 years, but also download copies of the works and run them with emulators or even real hardware, many of which come with .nfo files, or information files, in the downloadable executable zip file, where we can see the corresponding works Many works will come with .nfo files, or information files, in the downloadable executable zip file, where we can see the creator, year of creation, development tools, running platform, and sometimes also entries and awards. With this information alone, we can recover almost the entire process of personal computers from their emergence to their development and then to their popularity.

Almost all of Demoscene's works are non-profit, and there is no need to pay for the distribution or reuse of the content. Because of its span of content, its exhaustive organization, and its open access, Demoscene is like an encyclopedia of this kind of computer art, documenting the practice of people creating all kinds of audiovisual expressions with computers. Also because of this continuity and richness, it has become a national intangible cultural heritage in three European countries: Finland, Germany and Poland. In some other countries, such as Norway and France, local enthusiasts are also actively promoting the nomination of intangible cultural heritage.

## Summary
So this lesson is basically nearing the end of its content, so let's summarize.

What is a demo scene? A demo scene is a community of hobbyists who create stand-alone, sometimes very small (size-coding) computer programs that produce audio-visual effects called demos.

What is the difference between a demo program and a game or CG? Although it is technically similar to games, the experience of running a demo is significantly different from that of a game, mainly because demos are non-interactive. The most obvious difference between demos and CG animations is that the rendering of CG is not real-time, and the audience is watching a pre-rendered video program, but the audio-visual effects of demos are generated in real-time.

What is the relationship between the demo program and the platform? The effect of a demo program is usually closely related to the functional characteristics of the computer hardware and software platform. The presentation for old computers focuses more on the different audio-visual style brought by the different characteristics of the hardware. With the industrialization of game development, the demo scene dominated by small team development in recent years has gradually given up the pursuit of competing with game developers to produce the coolest effects under the latest hardware, and paid more attention to the human possibilities, which is the reason why the creation of old computer demos can persist. Under the old-fashioned platform, creators challenge or rather game on the various functional limitations of the old platform to produce different styles and expressive works through the struggle and compromise with the hardware and software features of the old platform. The history of the demo scene basically says that it covers all stages of personal computers, and its developed works basically cover a wide variety of personal computer platforms and home console platforms.

What are the distribution channels for demo programs? The most important channel for enthusiasts in the demo scene to release their works is the party, where the works can face a larger audience, get immediate feedback, and gain wider influence at the same time. But there are also authors, especially those who don't have a party in their country, who upload their work directly to the database represented by Pouet.net.

What kind of teams develop demo programs? Demo programs are usually produced by small teams of non-profit enthusiasts called demogroups, composed mainly of graphic designers, music producers and programmers.

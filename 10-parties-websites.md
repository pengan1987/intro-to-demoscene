# Parties and Websites
Today is lesson 10 of Introduction to demoscene, the penultimate lesson. In this lesson we want to focus on how the demoscene is organized and what the shape of its communication and exchange looks like.

We've been able to get a general idea of how the demoscene is organized through the previous lessons: much of the content about the demoscene is collected and organized on a dedicated website, and the people in the demoscene mainly meet offline to present, communicate, and compete. This is what we have mentioned in the first lesson, that there are two forms of enthusiasts gathering and communicating in the demoscene: online forums and offline gatherings.

Since the demoscene accompanies almost the whole process of personal computer popularization, significantly before the Internet became popular in the mid-1990s, the demoscene, while identified as a digital cultural phenomenon, is not entirely a cyber cultural phenomenon. In many cases, cyberspace, such as online forums and websites, were not the first site of the demoscene. In a context where "digital culture" is equated with "cyberculture" in many domestic contexts today, the demoscene constitutes a stark counterexample that digital culture does not necessarily depend on the Internet for its existence.

## The Formation of Demo Parties
Before the Internet became popular, offline parties were the first place where the demoscene took place. To this day, one of the most important activities of the demoscene, the demo compo, still takes place mainly at parties held offline.

The starting point of demo parties was the legalization of replication parties, a process that took place around the early 90s. At that time, the Internet was still far from popular, and paper and dial-up BBS were the main means of communication for the participants of the demoscene during this period. This site contains a large collection of printed paper on the demoscene, which provides a glimpse of the real state of the demoscene in the 80s and 90s.

One of the most helpful parts of the Got Papers is the party invitations and posters, through which we can understand the identity of the party organizers and their working methods. Through the materials provided in the Got Papers, we can see that parties in the 1980s and early 1990s were often referred to as "copy parties," confirming the connection between the demoscene and the volunteer warez community I mentioned in Session 3. The warez community was one of the first The main purpose of these parties was to invite enthusiasts to copy and distribute their cracked software at the parties.

In addition to the time and location of the event, many of the party posters included a map of the area around the party to make it easier for enthusiasts in other cities to find the party. . Some invitations will also mention that they can provide space for sleeping bag camping, while others will mention the drinks and beverages prepared by the organizers for the visiting participants as well.

Some gatherings as early as 1988, such as Sweden's Vortex 42 Computer Meeting 1988 began to mention that the gathering would host a demo contest, and after 1990 Demo compo became more common. More detailed competition groups such as demo (program) competitions, image competitions, music competitions, etc. also appeared in many gatherings.

One of the major changes in the early 1990s was the legalization of parties, with many organizers of previous copy parties moving to "legal parties" and stating explicitly that cracking was discouraged and that "piracy was at your own risk". The core of the parties shifted from software cracking and copying to demo program creation, demonstrations and competitions.

An important reason for this change was the police crackdown on software piracy, and the Got Papers website archives a set of documents called Marty/Radwar's House Search, provided by Marty, a member of the famous Commodore 64 software cracking group Radwar Enterprises 1941. Radwar's House Search), which documented a police search of Marty's house in late 1989, including the confiscation of 1,157 floppy disks. It was the legal risks and conflicts with the police faced by these late-80s crack enthusiasts that contributed to the shift from copy parties to demo parties.

In late 1991, the landmark demo party, The Party, was successfully held in Aars, Denmark, and its organization, contest rules, and prize money set served as a model for a series of demo parties that followed. The first wild demo of the digital video genre, Global Trash II, which we mentioned in session 6, was also launched at this party.

## Europe: the high ground for demo parties
Today, the most popular demo parties are basically in Europe, I did a simple statistic on pouet.net, and we found that in the last five years, if we don't count purely online competitions like Lovebyte, the most entries (releases) are Revision from Germany, CAFe from Russia, Assembly from Finland, and Sasquatch from Poland. Assembly from Finland, Silly venture from Poland, and Evoke from Germany.

During the development of demo parties, some of them gradually merged with LAN Parties, where games and e-sports are the main interaction. For example, The Gathering party in Norway, which will be mentioned later, and Assembly in recent years have shown the trend of integration. If we go through the Assembly party website today, the party not only incorporates games and e-sports, but also includes cosplay and live content in the pan-gaming field.

The German demo party Revision is currently the largest pure demo party that does not include game content, with hundreds of demos released in each session. In order to accommodate as many entries as possible, Revision has also designed more detailed categories, such as 4K demo, Amiga computer demo, etc. are often combined with other types of projects in recent years are separate.

Silly Venture in Poland is also one of the richest demo gatherings in terms of entries, and has been held for more than 20 years since 2000. Since Atari 8-bit and Atari ST are more popular in Poland, Silly venture participants also place more emphasis on the features of Atari computers.

This summer's Silly venture featured a live performance by Lotek Style, a musician active in the Atari ST enthusiast community
Germany's Revision, Finland's Assembly and Poland's Silly Venture are currently the top three demo gatherings in terms of the number of productions, and their host countries have all currently listed their demoscene as national intangible cultural heritage.

In addition to the above three countries, some other European countries also have demo parties that are more than ten years old, such as the Netherlands' Outline party, Hungary's Function party, Russia's CAFe (Kazan Computer Festival) and DiHalt party, and so on. The demo parties in different countries have different focus on computer platforms due to the different digital history of their host countries: SillyVenture in Poland focuses more on Atari computer platforms, while Outline in the Netherlands sees more MSX computer works.

The most prominent computer at the Russian party was the ZX Spectrum, which, as we mentioned in the fourth session, is the most popular 8-bit computer in Russia due to the economic level and the history of computer popularity, somewhat like the Red and White learning machine in China. 11M computers can also be found at the Russian CAFe and DiHalt gatherings.

Since demo gatherings are heavily concentrated in Europe, demos are sometimes referred to as "eurodemo", i.e. "European demos" in the famous hacker's dictionary Jargon File. We can also find an explanation of the word "demo", which mentions that demos "are often called eurodemos outside Europe, as most demoscene activity seems to be concentrated in Northern Europe, especially in Scandinavia. " In recent years, however, the term "eurodemo" has become less common than it once was, as the demoscene has spread its influence in the Americas, Australia and Japan.

## What are demo parties all about?
Next we look at what activities are included in a demo party, usually a compo is the centerpiece of a demo party. Smaller gatherings, such as the Russian DiHalt, have a schedule consisting entirely of competitions and no concerts, lectures, etc.

For medium-sized demo parties, such as Revision and Evoke Party in Germany, in addition to demo competitions, there will be lectures and keynote speeches, as well as live music performances.

Usually a big screen is set up in the main venue of the demo party, and the entries are displayed on the big screen to the audience, while the organizer of the event also sets up a temporary website for the audience to vote, and all the results are decided by the audience's votes.

The demo party will also make use of some of Demoscene's online infrastructure, such as the SceneSat "scene satellite" which is the demoscene's own live website.

SceneSat has also released its own music record series, The Sound of SceneSat, which can also be found on Netflix, so Even people who don't know Demoscene may have come across them through music.

Of course, for large demo parties, such as Assembly, there will also be games, cosplay, and other activities, so there is no set program for demo parties, and they can be configured "on demand".

## Global party events
Although Western Europe and Northern Europe are considered the core regions of the demoscene, there are still well-organized demo parties in Eastern European countries, although the history of these parties is not as long as those in Western Europe and Northern Europe, but the enthusiasm of local enthusiasts to organize and participate is no less than in other countries.

For example, the Demobit in Slovakia, from the construction of the website and the organization of the event can be seen from the organizers' dedication and rich content. 2019 Demobit party has more than thirty entries, and the competition items also cover various sub-categories of demoscene participants, such as Amiga, PC, Wild Demo, etc., and also set up a single scene competition for demo There was also a "One Scene Compo" for newcomers, a category that only allowed demos with a single effect to participate, encouraging newcomers to participate by reducing the complexity of their work.

I personally attended the 2017 Demosplash gathering in Pittsburgh, USA, which is hosted by the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Club and is currently the most attended demo gathering in the US. It is usually held between October and November each year.

Tokyo Demo Fest is the only demo gathering in East Asia. It is probably the only demo gathering where Chinese enthusiasts have competed live, with Shanghai-based enthusiast EvilRyu having competed live at Tokyo Demo Fest 2018. The Tokyo Demo Festival is also quite informative, adding live programming competitions in addition to the traditional compo, as well as lectures and live DJ/VJ music performances during the two-day party.

7DX is a demo party organized by the Department of Computer Engineering of the Turkish Straits University (Boğaziçi Üniversitesi), which was held for 14 sessions from 2002 to 2015. 7DX, together with Demosplash, shows that outside of Western and Northern Europe, universities often play an important role in organizing demo parties and spreading the culture of the demoscene.

Flash Party is a demo party held in Argentina. Flash Parties have been around in South America for a long time, with two Flash Parties held in 2005 and 2007, and after a hiatus of more than eleven years in 2007, they have been held continuously again in 2018. enthusiasm for demo parties.

Australia's Syntax Party is also a demo party that has been running for over a decade. Both oscilloscopes and writing projectors have been present at the Syntax Party. From the above examples we can find that today demo parties are not only happening in Europe, but have become a global computer culture event.

## Demo parties: the "revolving door" of the gaming industry
In Europe, many game professionals have had the experience of participating in demoscene and demo parties. The impact of demo parties on the games industry has been noted by European academics, and the 2014 article "Assembling a Game Development Scene? Uncovering Finland's largest demo party", published in the Italian games research journal G|A|M|E in 2014, examined the connection between the Finnish Assembly demo party and the games industry. The paper cites the 2009 paper "Computer Hobbyists and the Gaming Industry in Finland" which states.

> According to Saarikoski & Suominen (2009), the demoscene is often portrayed as a movement of "altruistic multimedia hackers struggling against the harsh realities of the entertainment industry" (p. 30). Along these lines, our analysis begins by exploring the commercial aspects of the conference. Interestingly, the interviews effectively disprove the romanticization narrative by highlighting how the initial rapid growth led to a reorientation towards more commercialized activities. This is largely reflected in the sponsors that the congress attracted in its first year, 1992. These sponsors were primarily hardware manufacturers, some of whom provided free equipment (such as sound cards) to demo attendees, most likely to promote their products.

The above paragraph points out the first category of commercial participants that emerged from the demo gathering, namely computer hardware companies. The other type of commercial participants are gaming companies that wish to recruit people at demo parties, and some of these companies will even recruit across borders in the demoscene.

> The sudden emergence of a strong community of programmers, graphic artists, and sound designers also meant that companies, even from as far away as the United States, began to see Assembly parties as a potential place to hire labor. Graphically more impressive than the digital games of the time, demos were seen as the perfect fit for a variety of positions on resumes.

Assembly a game development scene? Uncovering Finland's Largest Demo Gathering" concludes with a summary of the Assembly gathering's functions in five areas: meeting point, billboard, distribution channel, training ground, and melting pot:.

> Our analysis reveals the Assembly's various functions: a meeting point, a billboard, a distribution channel, a training ground, and a melting pot. In the absence of formal game development education, Assembly became the occasional school for graphic programming, technical skills, and creativity. As a condensed crossroads, Assembly provided visibility and a popular outlet for the Finnish demoscene and its most talented programmers to circulate their work. It formed a pedestal that received special attention from the media and talent scouts. Its importance was particularly evident in the early stages before the high-speed Internet, when it was the main opportunity for casual networking, cultural exchange and skills transfer.
Demo parties played an important role in the game industry, especially in the 3Dization of PC games in the 1990s, and many 3D game graphics techniques were pioneered or developed by fans of the demoscene, which then permeated the game industry. However, as mentioned in the text, the popularity of formal game development education in recent years has weakened the function of demoscene training practitioners. At the same time, many participants in the demoscene participate purely for fun and have no interest in entering the game industry.

But demo parties are still probably the closest part of the whole scene to business. Assembly parties are almost never denied sponsorship from the business community. assembly parties have accepted sponsorship from hardware manufacturers from the very beginning. Game manufacturers recruited through the party and turned some of the enthusiasts at the demo party into professional game developers. At this point, the Demo Party became a revolving door between the game industry and the hacker-developer community, providing a think tank for the game industry to house a large number of "in the wild" developers.

For hobbyists looking to break into the game industry, the demoscene provides them with the opportunity to hone and demonstrate their skills, as well as showcase their skills to the game industry. This research also guides us in bringing demo parties to China in the future, as it shows us that the sponsors of demo parties will mainly come from the computer hardware industry and the game industry.

Some hardware companies have also organized demo parties, such as Nvidia's NVScene parties in San Jose, San Francisco Bay Area in 2008, 2015 and 2016, and Intel Demo Compo hosted by Intel Germany in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Although no corporate title demo parties continue to be held today, commercial sponsorship is usually present at almost all demo parties.

## Impact on other types of computer parties
The influence of demo parties has spread to many venues outside of Demoscene. In Europe, especially in Northern Europe, many gaming or gaming LAN parties have evolved from demo parties, such as The Gathering in Norway, one of the oldest demo parties in history, which has continued since 1992. However, as its content focus has shifted from demos to games, The Gathering is today less used as a demo party and more considered a LAN Party, but there are still a significant number of demos released at The Gathering each year.

The Gathering is currently the second largest computer party in the world, after the Swedish DreamHack, which will be mentioned next, and in 2012 The Gathering also achieved the Guinness World Record for "fastest Internet speed" with 200Gbps of network bandwidth.

Sweden's DreamHack is currently the largest computer gathering, which started as a demo party in Malung, Sweden in 1994, and moved to Jönköping in 2001 and continues today. In 2021, it broke the "fastest internet speed" record with 1.6 Tbps. Today, DreamHack has grown into a global gaming party brand with events in Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, the US, Australia and India.

Both DreamHack and The Gathering are today gaming and eSports focused events, while both can be clearly traced back to the origins of Demo Party. This also shows the role of the demoscene in building the infrastructure of computer culture in Europe, not only for games, but also for the various computer parties that developed from demo parties to provide a showcase for technological subcultures such as computer appearance modding (PC modding).

Outside of Europe, some computer culture parties that are not obviously related to Demoscene are also starting to include demo parties, for example, MAGFest (Music and Game Festival) in the United States is currently the most important game music festival brand in the United States, which has lasted for 20 years since 2002. MAGFest started to add Shader programming competitions originating from demo parties, and in 2019 and 2020 it held more complete demo parties with multiple entry categories.

If we search online for videos of these computer gatherings, we will find that many of the programs are very much in the tension of variety and entertainment, and that computer culture is not as nerdy as many people think, but can be watchable and entertaining. Various computer parties are such a type of bridge connecting IT industry and cultural and creative industry.

Elements related to demoscene also appear at some computer security-related conferences such as LayerOne and DEF CON. Their competition rules are different from the usual demo parties, and often a separate hardware is developed specifically for use with the competition platform. For example, the competition at the LayerOne gathering revolved around a L1 Demoscene Board developed on a Microchip PIC24 microcontroller.

DEF CON, which is also a computer security gathering, is one of the few foreign computer gathering brands that have ever entered China, and I attended DEF CON China 1.0 in Beijing's 798 Art District in 2019. one of the features of DEF CON gatherings is its electronic badges (Badge), which are themselves small game boards containing small puzzle games consisting of buttons and LED lights to solve small puzzles. In Hackaday's 2018 documentary BadgeLife, this electronic badge-making activity is compared to hardware engineers' inheritance of the demoscene's competition culture.

All of the above examples illustrate the cross-disciplinary and all-encompassing influence of the demoscene on computer culture. From video games to information security, all areas of overseas computer culture are permeated with the demoscene's influence. Since the demoscene is almost completely absent from China, its brief appearance in the mid-2000s has left little trace, which leads to a large cultural gap in our understanding of overseas techno-cultural communities.

## demoscene related websites
For domestic researchers, it is a lesson that must be learned to truly understand the overseas techno-cultural demoscene. Fortunately the demoscene is equally active on the Internet and provides researchers with many resources that can be used as a starting point for research.

### Resources/Databases.
Pouet.net is the site I personally use most often as a repository for all types of resources on demoscene. The BBS, which is over 20 years old, documents many of the events that have happened and are happening in the scenes and is also great for posting questions related to the scenes. The artwork (prods) section contains a well-organized catalog of works, most of which can be downloaded and run, perhaps the biggest limitation is whether you can find the hardware or emulator to run them.

The GotPapers mentioned initially in this session is also an important research resource that holds many paper materials related to the demoscene, including correspondence, posters, lists, etc. These materials are particularly useful for studying the scene before the widespread use of the Internet in the 1990s.

A site often mentioned in many overseas papers is CSDB, whose full name is The C-64 Scene Database, or Commodore 64 Scene Database, which archives more than 10,000 demo and crack teams, more than 20,000 community participants, over 200,000 entries, more than 2,400 events, and 2,087 BBSes.

The Amiga also has a similar scene database, the ADA (Amiga Demoscene Archive, Amiga demoscene archive). In addition to this, as mentioned in Session 8, Amiga computers have played an important role in the development of Tracker music and chip music, and the Amiga community has a dedicated music database, namely AMP (Amiga Music Preservation, Amiga Music Preservation), which provides a list of music compositions from various periods on Amiga computers by authors, teams and countries, while all works can be downloaded as MOD, S3M and XM files in Tracker format, and they can usually be played with Foobar2000 or VLC, or edited and recreated with Tracker software.

If one wishes to find demo party related information, the most important resource is demoparty.net, which has been running since 2005 and keeps a lot of demo party related information, and many parties that are still in preparation or will be held soon will also post their information on this site.

### Academic, research-related sites
Some overseas scholars who are concerned with the demoscene also post their research developments on the site. One of the most important resources for chip music is Chipflip, which is maintained by Anders Carlsson (Goto80) and contains articles that are usually short in length but cover a wide range of topics. In addition to the demoscene and chip music introduced in this series of courses, it also includes quite a few ASCII Art, PETSCII Art related textual graphic art content. In addition, Goto80's personal website goto80.com also includes a lot of content related to demoscene and computer culture.

Another place to find research resources related to the demoscene is the Finnish media culture journal Widerscreen. Due to the early development and high level of the demoscene in Finland, and the fact that it has been recognized as a Finnish intangible cultural heritage, its related academic research is also relatively advanced, with many articles related to the demoscene and other technical cultures such as chip music and ASCII Art Many articles related to demoscene and other techno-cultures such as chip music and ASCII Art, both in English and Finnish, have been published in Widerscreen.

Another resource for demoscene research is the Demoscene Research website, which is an academic resource for demoscene research maintained by researchers from Finland, Germany, and other places.

### Infrastructure sites
The last category of websites can be considered as infrastructure for the whole demoscene, for example SceneSat is an online radio and TV station that provides video and audio feeds and archives for demoscene-related events. For demo scenarios, commercial video sites like Twitch cannot be trusted, as Revision Party 2021 was banned by Twitch for no reason during its broadcast. After the ban, Revision Party chose to use the Chaos Computer Club's C3Voc (CCC Video Operation Center), which we mentioned in the second session, to broadcast.

untergrund.net is a web space provider dedicated to the demoscene, offering free web space for demo scenario related projects. party and other websites are hosted by it.

That's all for today. I believe that through this lesson, you will have a clearer understanding of the online and offline communication spaces in the demoscene.

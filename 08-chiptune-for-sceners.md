# Chip Music as Hacker Culture
Today is the eighth session of the Introduction to the Demo Scene, and in this session I hope to answer the question posed at the end of the last session: why do the core players in the chip music scene oppose the idea of chip music as some sort of video game peripheral?

In the last session, we found that both Bryan Chan, the founder of Vancouver's Chip Music Society, and Sulumi, one of the most influential chip musicians in China, the leaders of the chip music community, were all expressing one view: "chip music is not video game music. One of the most important reasons for this is that after the game industry phased out the use of programmable sound generators (PSG)-based chip music in the 1990s, the core group of chip music creators has shifted significantly: from professional game developers to an underground community of computer enthusiasts centered on the Demoscene. With this shift, the mainstream values of the chip music community have also shifted towards a "hacker ethic" and a clear divergence from the commercialized video game business.

## Chip music ≠ game music
Chip musician and researcher Anders Carlsson (GOTO80) writes in "Chip music: low-tech data music sharing

> Since today's chip music scene is largely non-commercial, the commercial industry of video games is beyond the scope of this paper.

The primary question we hope to answer in this session is both how did the chip music scene, which is closely linked to video games in terms of production methods and performance equipment, come to be? And why does this scene emphasize its independence from video game music?

In the overseas chip music scene, there is a consensus among almost all participants, whether researchers, musicians, or community leaders, that they intentionally delineate their activities in the chip music scene from the video game realm, which clearly runs counter to previous descriptions of chip music in China that link chip music to nostalgic games.

But why is this? A footnote in Chip Music: Low-tech Data Music Sharing caught my attention when the author mentioned that his definition of "scenes" came from Alan O'Connor's 2002 paper Local Scenes and Dangerous Crossroads: A Theory of Punk and Cultural Hybridity (2002). Local Scenes and Dangerous Crossroads: Punk and theories of Cultural Hybridity), which states.

> When punks use the word "scene" they mean actively creating the infrastructure to support punk bands and other forms of creative activity.

Instead, the widespread use of CD tracks and pre-recorded audio in games brought about a series of industry changes that actually suppressed the continued development of chip music in the games industry.

## The end of the era of game chip music
In the article "Chiptune, Ownership and the Digital Underground" included in last year's issue of The Cambridge Companion to Video Game Music (2021), quoted Mark Knight (TDK), author of the music for the Amiga version of Wing Commander (1990), argues that the advent of CD tracks has taken away the character of game music:.


> In my opinion ...... these new formats have killed computer game music. It started with the PlayStation, when [composers] were no longer forced to be limited to creating music in a certain style, in a certain way, and using certain instruments, and suddenly you could go into a studio and you could record an orchestra, a rock band, or whatever you wanted, really, and put it on a CD as Red Book audio. suddenly, game music no longer sounded distinctive. It sounded just like everything else.

In this paper, Colin Anderson, then head of audio at DMA Designs and responsible for the music for games such as Lemmings (1991) and Grand Theft Auto (1997), is quoted in an interview that further adds to the impact of CD audio on game music The interview was conducted in Abertay, UK. This interview is part of the Video Game Design and Development online course at Abertay University, UK: Interview with Colin Anderson

> Probably the most important change is the fidelity of the audio you can create. [Samples and CD Audio] gives you access to the same resources as the film and TV industry ...... This means that for the first time you can use real instrument recordings, real sound effects ...... rather than having to synthesize them.

While acknowledging the improved audio fidelity that CD tracks bring, Colin Anderson also mentions that CD tracks are harder to integrate into the interactivity of the game than music synthesized by sound chips:.

> On the downside, we lost interactivity for a while. Synthesizer chips are particularly good because their code is quite underlying. The code is very good at reacting to the game as it runs, and that disappeared when we started using CDs and things like that .......

In addition, Colin Anderson points to Grand Theft Auto 2 as an example of an important change that CD tracks brought to game music: in some cases, game companies began working with traditional record labels to license popular music from the labels as built-in tracks. This has somewhat weakened the originality of game music.

> For Grand Theft Auto 1, [all of the soundtrack material] was 100% completely original material, all recorded by ourselves ...... In Grand Theft Auto 2, that started to change. Once the game became a success, people suddenly wanted to license their favorite tracks, and [this commercial pressure] increased [with each subsequent release].

We will see that once music production in the game industry entered the era of pre-recorded tracks and CD audio as the primary medium, there was a significant change for developers of game music, both in the production process and in the expectations of customers for the music. It can be said that the era of chip music for games came to an end, after which the demo scene became almost the only refuge for chip music, and chip music gradually went to the opposite side of the game industry. The article "Chip Music, Ownership and the Digital Underground" reads.

> Thus, the era of PSG video game music was brought to an end by the commercial realities of video game production and the growing technological capabilities of home consoles. However, while chip music may have disappeared from gaming, reports of its demise have been greatly exaggerated. Chip music is about to develop an edge that will put it in direct opposition to the corporate world of professional game development.

## The combination of demo scenes and chip music
The combination of chip music with the demo scene stems in large part from the use of chip music by the voluntary piracy (warez) community. The demos at the heart of the demo scene originated as cracktros created by the volunteer pirate community to show off their technical prowess.

The size of cracktros had to be small enough to fit on the boot sector of a floppy disk and to run and animate before loading the game, which is the root of the size-coding tradition in the demo scene. And this quest for minimizing program capacity makes chip music the most suitable music format for cracking headers naturally, as written in the article "Chip Music, Ownership and the Digital Underground".

> The code to execute the crack program must be compact and efficient enough to be loaded into the boot sector of a floppy disk so that the cracked game can be easily uploaded and downloaded from an electronic bulletin board service (BBS) via telephone line dial-up and rewritten onto a new floppy disk. simple waveforms and sequences of PSG music can be stored as space-efficient single-cycle samples and tracks and played on a sample-based system and thus accomplish this purpose perfectly. Thus chip music becomes the sound of the digital underground.

The paper also mentions that in the voluntary piracy (warez) community, many times the impact of well-produced cracked credits surpasses even the cracked game itself.

> Over time, the competition to showcase coding ability, graphics and musical creativity becomes more important than the crack itself. End-users will actively seek out cracked software in order to obtain crack headers, making the game itself an almost insignificant byproduct of the cracking process.

Cracked titles eventually became more attractive than games, and eventually existed separately from cracked games, and these "cracked titles", not involved in cracking activities, gradually became a separate folk art form, namely demos, and the community that produced them is the subject of this series of courses: demos! demoscene.

The demoscene gradually diverged from the voluntary piracy community in the early 1990s, focusing its activities on creating demos with complex audio and visual effects, rather than engaging in software cracking activities, at about the same time as game companies abandoned the use of sound chips. As the demo scene's use of sound chips became more widespread, especially with the development of Tracker (track sequencer) type music production software, the demo scene surpassed the game industry as the core group for chip music production, both in terms of the abundance of creative tools and the quantity and quality of their work. With this change, the creative ethics and values of the chip music community have also moved closer to the non-commercial demo scene and are clearly differentiated from the game industry. Chip Music, Ownership and the Digital Underground states.

> Making and sharing cracktros became an end in itself and evolved into Demoscene, a distributed online community of digital art practices dedicated to producing complex real-time audiovisual presentations. This combination of anti-commercialism, a unique sense of community and a culture of sharing marked a parting of the ways in which chip music, an integral part of the crack scene and Demoscene, was being made in relation to the increasingly professionalized and corporate approach to video game music production.

> It also points to a difference in mindset. On one side is the corporate view that there is value and cost in producing professional content, whether music or software, and that companies are therefore justified in protecting their investment by using a combination of digital rights management (DRM) and litigation to ensure that only legitimate copies are in circulation.

> In contrast, the Hacker Ethic, the core philosophy of hacker culture that originated at MIT in the 1950s and 1960s, presents the opposite of this corporate-driven process of turning everything into intellectual property, namely "the belief that information sharing is a powerful benefit, by writing free software and facilitating access to information whenever possible. Sharing ...... expertise is an ethical imperative".

Hacker ethics is the key to explaining many of the digital cultural phenomena that are difficult to understand at home, but are prevalent overseas, especially in Europe. For example, the voluntary piracy (warez) community, which we detailed in Session 3, has made software piracy an illegal thing in most countries since the mid-1990s. Yet people still take the risk of doing such an illegal thing non-profit and voluntarily.

Today, in many European countries, pirate parties, whose main political advocacy is against the existing intellectual property system, are very active, and in Germany, Sweden, Austria, and the Czech Republic, pirate parties have gained some seats in parliament. Echoing this, European courts are also very cautious about protecting software functions with patent rights.

I think we must be equally mindful, in the context of today's boom in "knowledge payment" in China, where "copyright defenders" seem to occupy the moral high ground, that the notion of intellectual property rights promoted by the commercial sector is not naturally in the public interest, and that moral norms and laws should not favor the commercial sector. Nor should ethics and legal regulations suppress competition and innovation in favor of the strongest in the business world. Europe's thriving computer underground culture and its challenge to the commercial world clearly gives us an excellent frame of reference, as noted in Chip Music, Ownership, and the Digital Underground.

> History has proven beyond doubt that Bill Gates and Paul Allen were right about the commercial potential of software as a commodity, but the continued growth of underground voluntary piracy communities and the patterns of legalized freeware, Creative Commons, and open source publishing and distribution suggest that attitudes toward sharing digital content remain as strong as ever.
The Cambridge Companion to Video Game Music, p. 42

> However, this anti-commercial ethos and ubiquitous culture of sharing, present in the chip music scene and more broadly among the diverse subcultural groups lurking beneath the increasingly corporate digital mainstream, certainly poses a challenge: as Bill Gates has pointed out, who would create professional content if no one was prepared to pay for it - -whether it's music, games or productivity software? However, history shows that content will still be produced, commercially and to a very high standard, in non-professional communities, as has happened in the chip music scene. The Cambridge Companion to Video Game Music, p. 49

We may currently see countless product plans in China promoting the idea of "creator economies" and "paying for knowledge" to bring creators into the "platform economy", and these plans almost But we do see that open source communities, Demoscene, chip music communities, and even domestic subtitling groups are creating a lot of content while also being non-profit.

It is worth noting that not all Demoscene creations are driven by a hacker ethic, and Anders Carlsson, author of Chip Music: Low-tech Data Music Sharing, sees a simpler and more direct reason for the involvement of teenage crackers:.

> The ideals of parts of the cracker community are similar to those of hackers and phone flyers, but it seems that many of the early crackers were kids, cracking games for fun, intellectual challenge, and "street cred".

I think a comparable community in China is the electronic dictionary enthusiast community, where the teenagers who hid under their desks to write games for Wen Qu Xing had motivations that were very similar to those of the teenage software crackers in the West.

## Commercial computer music software before Tracker
Before Tracker came along, the environment for developers and regular users to make music for their computers was very different. As we have already mentioned in the previous lesson, for game developers in the 80s, modifying the program code directly or using MML (Music Marco Language) were the common ways to write music for games, but both were quite difficult and time-consuming, and such a high threshold was almost only available to developers employed by game companies or hobbyists proficient in programming to write chips in this way music.

But for non-developers they are not completely without options, as early as the early 1980s, some commercially available commercial software has tried to provide ordinary users with the ability to write or play music using the sound chip in their home computers. The 1982 Commodore Music Maker, for example, offered a stacked keyboard case for the Commodore 64 that converted the Commodore 64's computer keyboard into a piano-like black-and-white key music keyboard with accompanying music performance and editing software.

If you look at it from the perspective of a music toy, the Commodore Music Maker is largely passable, and it shows some of the features of the Commodore SID chip. Another early music production software that was once widely used was Will Harvey's Music Construction Set, which was one of the early staples of Art & Electric ( EA) one of the early staples, and more feature-rich than Commodore Music Maker.

We will find that commercial music software for non-developers almost always tries to mimic the common pentatonic score on the screen. While it is intuitive for users with some musical knowledge, for the sound chip as a miniaturized synthesizer, this design hides the functional details of the chip music and weakens the sound design part of electronic music.

## 1986: SoundMonitor
In 1986, Chris Hülsbeck developed SoundMonitor for the creation of Commodore 64 music, starting with the idea of simplifying the music development process on the Commodore 64, which was still based on the previous hexadecimal code-based Commodore 64 music editing process, but made significant improvements to the previous machine code editor-based workflow. process has been significantly improved. Many of the software's practices were inherited by the subsequent track sequencer (Tracker). The origins and influence of SoundMonitor are reviewed in the 2018 book Bits and Pieces: A History of Chiptunes, published by composer Kenneth B. McAlpine's, a researcher at the University of Melbourne.

> When Hülsbeck wrote Shadows, he was still writing music by entering note data as hexadecimal values directly into the Machine Code Monitor, (Machine Code Monitor) a piece of software that allowed the user to view and modify data stored in the computer's memory. This is a perfectly workable method, but only if Hülsbeck knows what values to write to which memory location. For others, this was completely opaque. knowing that this process could be improved, Hülsbeck began working on a specialized music editor. He worked on it throughout the summer of 1986 and submitted the result, SoundMonitor, to 64er magazine, which published the code as their monthly list.

> SoundMonitor, for all intents and purposes, was a track sequencer prototype, and many of the elements that can be seen in its interface became typical of the practice of later track sequencer software. Figure 5.3 shows its interface: three vertically scrolling tracks, one for each channel, and dedicated control commands to trigger glissando effects and arpeggiated chords. In terms of user-friendliness, it is a huge improvement over coding music directly or modifying data in a machine code monitor, and it provides a very detailed platform for programming SIDs for musicians who understand the technical basics. Bits and Pieces: A History of Chiptunes (p. 131)

Because SoundMonitor was printed directly in the liner notes of 64er magazine as hexadecimal machine code without any anti-reversal encryption, SoundMonitor was not only used to develop music programs for the Commodore 64, but it was also adapted secondarily itself and used by many developers as part of their demo programs.

The widespread acceptance of reversals and adaptations of established works and development tools in the Commodore 64 enthusiast scene is very different from the general music scene, which is very concerned with originality, and even goes to court over the similarity of a few bars. In the article "Bit by Bit: The History of Chip Music" the collaboration between German musician Thomas Detert and the X-Ample demo team is used as an example of how they improved and used SoundMonitor and incorporated it into their own compositions.

> Thomas Detert, a well-known composer of C64 video games, soon began using SoundMonitor to create scores for the Omega 8 demo team . However, the more he tried to move forward, the more he found that the CPU load required to drive the process was too great; the music he was writing in SoundMonitor was taking resources away from the graphics program the group needed.

> To improve the situation, Detert turned to his friends at X-Ample Architectures, another German demo group. Together they combined the core of SoundMonitor with a new driver written by Markus Schneider and a front-end interface written by Joachim Fraeder to create the X-Ample Music Player ......

> This method of developing custom programs by hacking and adapting the work of others is quite common and may go some way to explaining the consistency of the C64 sound. Schneider notes that "90% of music players are based on Rob Hubbard's technology ..... Most people just optimize it and invent more tricks". Bits and Pieces: A History of Chiptunes (p. 132)

## Sampling: Tracker in the modern sense
The Amiga computer, introduced in 1985, was the first multimedia computer in the modern sense, with audio and video capabilities far ahead of its contemporaries. One of the most powerful features was the Amiga computer's audio system, which could play four channels of PCM audio samples simultaneously.

The Amiga 500, introduced in 1987, was even cheaper, selling for just $699 or £499 at launch, which made it quite popular in Europe. The Amiga computer came standard with an audio output interface, but did not have audio sampling and recording capabilities. To make better use of the Amiga computer's audio capabilities, a series of audio sampling peripherals designed specifically for the Amiga computer were developed. They were usually small boxes attached to the Amiga computer's printer interface that converted the external input analog audio signal into a digital audio signal that could be processed in software. In the late 1980s, a set of Amiga computers and sampling expansion cards as the core of home recording equipment cost no more than £ 1,000.

The combination of Amiga computers and sampling capabilities greatly expanded the material available to amateur computer music enthusiasts in the late 1980s, allowing them to sample and collage music from common home recording media, such as cassette tapes, vinyl records and radio. In the past, this often required the use of expensive studio equipment, such as Fairlight CMI, which costs tens of thousands of dollars to complete.

The first music production software to hit the Amiga platform was still notation-based, including Will Harvey's Music Construction Set, which was ported to the Amiga computer as Deluxe Music Construction Set, and Aegis Sonix. More innovative music production software emerged during the same period, such as EA Instant Music, which presented musical contours in horizontal scrolls and automatically matched chords algorithmically.

In 1987, Karsten Obarski developed music production software called Ultimate Soundtracker, which combined the sampling power of the Amiga computer with the vertical scrolling interface of SoundMonitor, and improved the operation of SoundMonitor in a way that was more suitable for music production.

> Then, in 1987 Karsten Obarski, a programmer and musician at the German software company EAS, was asked by his friend Guido Bartels to create a C64-style soundtrack for a brick-bashing style game he was developing. A few weeks ago, Obarski bought himself an Amiga 1000 and had already written some simple sample-triggered music programs. He had also used Chris Hülsbeck's SoundMonitor on the C64 and liked its vertical column layout. His Ultimate Soundtracker combines the two, as shown in Figure 5.6.

> Obarski simplified SoundMonitor's interface by cutting out some of the complexity of the C64 program and grouping the Amiga's four channels into an editable 64-step grid called samples (patterns). Each sample displays the four channels in vertically scrolling cell columns titled Melody, Accompaniment, Bass and Percussion, with a horizontal time bar extending over all four tracks showing the current playback position. These samples give a brief overview of the order and structure of the music, like a musical spreadsheet that can be sequenced and arranged in different ways to produce a song. Bits and Pieces: A History of Chiptunes (p. 138)

To some extent, Tracker's interface and mode of operation is even easier than notation-based music editing software, especially for users who can use Tracker like a drum machine without knowledge of traditional music theory such as the pentatonic.

> This straightforward interface completely eliminates graphical metaphors and focuses on presenting a complete overview of the music "source code" through concise textual representations. This makes learning the screen layout quite simple and simplifies the process of reading and editing music for those who are not proficient in traditional notation. The software's simplified layout and button interface turns the process of composing music into something more akin to touch typing music. Bits and Pieces: A History of Chiptunes (p. 139)

> At the same time, you get the best elements of a drum machine, you can string samples together, you can see where the drums are relative to other things in time, and then you can tweak your melody around it. So it's kind of like all the advantages of a drum machine and the advantages of classical notation. It's also very close to the hardware, so you know there's really no separation between you and your instrument, and you feel like you're really getting the best part of it (the drum machine's capabilities). Bits and Pieces: A History of Chiptunes (p. 140)

## MOD format and MOD scenes
Ultimate Soundtracker was the first music production software to use the sampled track sequence mode, and is the origin of the name "Tracker". The file format Karsten Obarski designed for it, "MOD", was made compatible with a number of subsequent Tracker programs. In fact, StarTrekker, DOC Soundtracker, NoiseTracker, ProTracker and others were all reverse-engineered from Ultimate Soundtracker, fixing some of the bugs in the original version of Ultimate Soundtracker and improving the stability of the program. The entry for the Amiga game profile site ExoticA documents the process by which Ultimate 

In the process Karsten Obarski's copyright was ignored by the crack scene, and Ultimate Soundtracker, sold as commercial software, was not a widespread success. However, SoundTracker's production process was widely adopted by Demoscene in the process, and the MOD format became the de facto standard for sample sequence music formats on Amiga computers. Many times "MOD music" is also used as a generic term for sample-based music files produced with Tracker software.

Compared to PSG music, which relies heavily on hardware features, sample-based Tracker music keeps file sizes small enough to play relatively consistently across devices. Before MP3 music became popular in the early 90s, Tracker/MOD music was also the most active music sharing community on FidoNet, Usenet and the Internet, and formed "music albums" by disk: disks containing only music were called "music A disk containing only music is called a "music disk", while a disk containing a mix of music, images and programs is called a "pack disk". The community that formed around the production and distribution of Tracker music was also known as the "mod scene".

> In the days before the Internet, file sharing was much less complicated than it is today. Music files were often shared on separate bulletin board systems (BBS), remote computer servers that hosted software and services. By the mid-1980s, Fidonet, a global network connecting different BBSs, began to emerge, making it easier to post and exchange mods.

> This online sharing occurred primarily in North America and Western Europe, and from it emerged an active community of practitioners - not just musicians, but programmers and graphic artists - who developed custom musicdisk and packdisk for fonts and graphics for musicdisk and packdisk, packaged, distributable music anthologies that resemble digital concept albums. Bits and Pieces: A History of Chiptunes (p. 144)

After the 1990s, digital audio playback and recording became a basic feature of PC sound cards, and Tracker/MOD music became widely available on IBM PC-compatible machines. In particular, warez scenes, which were closely associated with demo scenes, often had Tracker music data embedded in the registry (Keygen), so that outside of North America and Western Europe, where demo scenes had less of a presence, Tracker was often also referred to as "Keygen Music". .

## Why not MIDI?
In China, due to the unfamiliarity of the demo and mod scenes, Tracker music is often incorrectly described as "MIDI music". This is very common in texts about "registry music". However, overseas, MIDI has a much weaker presence in discussions about chip music and Demoscene.

One important reason for this is that MIDI is much more expensive to use than Tracker. Although the Atari ST computer, which had a built-in MIDI interface and was much less expensive, was introduced almost simultaneously with the Amiga in 1985, the Atari ST computer had much less built-in audio capability. The original version of the Atari ST only had a built-in Yamaha YM2149 sound chip, the version manufactured by Yamaha under license of the AY-3-8910, which was basically the same as the Amstrad CPC, MSX and other eight-bit computers.

And to fully play the role of the Atari ST built-in MIDI interface, it must be used together with the synthesizer and multi-track recorder and other equipment that supports MIDI interface, and this will obviously increase the cost of use, and support for MIDI sampling equipment is more expensive, in the late 1980s, small recording studios can afford to sell the Akai S900 sampler price is 1699 pounds, or about £5300 today, which is still quite expensive for the average household.

Another reason that limited the popularity of MIDI in the demo scene and chip music community was the difficulty of balancing creative flexibility and broad compatibility with limited budgets in the late 80s and early 90s as the standard for recording industry design.

For recording studios, MIDI protocols served as communication protocols between synthesizers, samplers, and computers, allowing for a wide variety of sound effects to be generated by connecting a large number of different devices in series, with little regard for the compatibility of the resulting data in different environments. When using different brands of sound sources, the same MIDI data could produce different sounds.

Standards such as General MIDI and Standard MIDI File in 1991 attempted to standardize MIDI by specifying 128 basic instruments. But this clearly limited creative flexibility, especially by failing to include the vocal and natural ambient sound samples common in Tracker music. At the same time, PC sound card manufacturers rarely strictly implement the General MIDI standard, and most sound cards use the built-in FM synthesis chip to imitate the sound of the instruments in the standard, which is obviously less straightforward for participants in the demo scene seeking to demonstrate their technical prowess than making music directly for the OPL2/OPL3 FM synthesis chip used in PC sound cards.

## Summary
It can be said that PSG-based game music and Tracker-based demo scene music are the two main sources of "chip music", and "chip music" (chiptune) also originated from the demo scene to describe those imitating PSG sounds The works of.

> As more and more sound-chip style music disks came into circulation, mod fans found they needed a term to distinguish them from other forms of Tracker music. Sure, the Amiga could sound like PSG, but it could also sound like a rock band or an orchestra. By 1990, "chip" (chip) had begun to appear in mod filenames as a stylistic moniker, and in 1991 the term chiptune, meaning a piece of chip music, was used as the title of Nuke's (Martin Iveson) work " mod.chiptune-12k" appeared on the Anarchy package disk. Bits and Pieces: A History of Chiptunes" (pp. 145-146)

When discussing chip music today, domestic media often avoid the contribution and influence of the demo scene on chip music and cater to the nostalgic sentiment of game enthusiasts, which completely ignores the spiritual core of chip music as an underground cultural scene against commercialization and is not fair and objective enough. In the next session, we hope to answer these questions by tracing the development of chip music from around the turn of the millennium to the present day, and to decipher the controversies surrounding the "fake chip" scene in the mid to late 90s, outside of the LSDJ, Nanoloop and other independent demo scenes. In the next session, we hope to answer these questions by tracing the development of chip music from around the turn of the millennium to the present day, and to explain the characteristics of the "new school" music scene that emerged in the mid- to late-1990s outside of the independent demo scenes such as LSDJ and Nanoloop.

# Disappeared Chinese demoscene
This is the eleventh lesson of the Introduction to demoscene. In the previous lessons we talked a lot about European topics, this lesson is the time to discuss the situation in China. "Did Demoscene ever exist in China?" This question has been brought up before, both overseas and in China, but perhaps the only one who has seriously answered it is myself.

Even today, most Chinese outside of this classroom have a vague impression of the demoscene; many have heard the registrar's music, but few have a clear idea of the means by which demos are made, let alone the community organization and motivation for their creation.

In 2017, the editor of the then VICE Chinese website (Zijie is currently running Copyinfo) asked me for an article. I completed two articles on Demoscene in response, namely "A brief history of computer demos" and "The legacy of 8-bit urchins: cracked software, demo communities, chip music, and retro hardware".

## One question after another
But one question that has been bothering me is whether the Chinese Internet community has ever been connected to the overseas Demoscene community, and furthermore, whether a Demoscene community ever existed in China itself. I am obviously not the only one who is curious about this question, EvilRyu's question "Why did sycini disappear? Is there still a demoscene group in China?" answered my question to some extent, but the new question he posed was equally challenging.

EvilRyu's question was not answered in full for several years after it was raised in 2014, and my article "A Brief History of the Chinese Demoscene Community" was the result. I was able to get in touch with many of the participants at the time, and to review in some detail the involvement of Chinese enthusiasts in the production of Sycini and the demo before and after.

But are the Max/MSP, Processing, and other "creative programming" courses mentioned at the end of the article "A Fleeting Moment" really a continuation of the practice of the demoscene enthusiasts? What is the connection between their communities? For me, there are still many gaps left.

An early record of a series of creative programming-related events that is publicly searchable online is a series of events organized by the domestic training organization "OF COURSE Thinking" starting in 2015.

Based on some of the recorded speakers' topics and their biographies, I can roughly deduce that around 2012-14, the domestic IT industry seemed to have gone through a period of "data visualization" popularity, and some engineers transformed during this period and then became active as new media artists, many of whom are still active in Many of them are still active in the related fields, and there should be no obvious gap among them.

I therefore focus my research on the period between 2008, when Sycini disappeared, and 2015, when the ex officio record began, and I want to understand several things: where did the participants go after Sycini disappeared? When and where did the creative programming community in China start to emerge? What were the main communication channels? Who are the community leaders? Did they overlap with the previous demo authors? I tried to consult with some organizers and participants of early creative programming communities in China to get some preliminary answers.

## The Beginning of Creative Programming in China: The Demo Dream
As I mentioned in "Blip: A Brief History of the Chinese Demoscene Community", the 2005 article "Dream of demos" by Leo Ye (eapass), who lives in Chongqing, was one of the first Chinese articles that introduced the demoscene in some detail, mentioning topics such as the demoscene, disk magazines, demo parties, Tracker music, and so on. In the comment section of this article we can find the interaction between Sunnm (Sun Mo), the organizer of Sycini, and Leo Ye. In the message, Leo Ye politely declined Sun Mo's invitation to join demoscene.

But Yelio's influence on the Chinese Internet community is not limited to one article; his personal website "Art of Computing" shares the first demos that Chinese enthusiasts were exposed to. Exceed - Heaven Seven, Some bookprint and a broken heart - Replay, Please the cookie thing - aardbei, Ghost Castle (fr-08: .the . product - Farbrausch), and many more. product - Farbrausch), etc. This batch of demos is probably the only batch of demos that have been widely distributed in China so far, and it is also the only batch that many netizens who did not know the demoscene beforehand have access to.

It can be said that except for the early contactors such as Ye Liao and Sun Mo, a large number of domestic enthusiasts are in the state of "knowing the demos but not the scene", and some demos are spread under the names of "64k animation", "hacking Some demos were disseminated under the names of "64k animation", "hacking contest", etc., but the disseminators had no background knowledge of the demoscene. In the popular Chinese video site Beili Beili, "Ghost Castle" was uploaded several times under the name of "programming contest", and two of the uploaders' videos were played more than one million times.

In "The Dream of Demos," Yelio mentions his feeling that "demos are the result of a team effort, a combination of programming, graphics, and music, all of which are necessary for a perfect computer work." But the concept of creating demos and organizing scenes was still a hazy "dream", both for the level of multimedia programming in China and for people's understanding of European digital culture at the time.

## Computer animation as an educational tool
Although the concept of demos and demoscene is still very vague and unfamiliar to domestic netizens today, the fact that some enthusiasts in the 2000s were able to notice the existence of demos, and that they also felt the meaning of demos as a way to show off their technical skills, shows that domestic enthusiasts at least had some understanding of animation production. At least to some extent, they can understand the connection between the complexity of animation and the level of computer application.

An important background behind this is that computer animation was an important part of computer education for young people at that time, and the core of the "Start with Children" event that started computer education in China in 1984 was the computer animation education activities organized by the Shanghai Children's Palace.

Until the mid-1990s, the only people who had access to computer animation for adults in China were probably the staff of film and television-related organizations, as evidenced by the fact that almost all computer animation papers on the Internet were published in professional journals of the film and television industry. For example, the founder of MihaYu, Cai HaoYu, got the opportunity to contact computer animation related technology from his parents who were teaching computer courses in colleges and universities. "In 1999, four of them, including Cai Haoyu, were selected because of their expertise in computer animation.

I also got a copy of Autodesk Animator between 1998 and 1999, and the person who copied this software to me was my classmate in elementary school, who is currently a teacher of a university's choreography-related program.

If they are not satisfied with playing games on the computer and want to explore other things with the computer and seek help from their teachers at school or youth centers, basically the teachers will give them two directions The other direction is computer animation.

My high school alumnus, Wang Xin, is one of the more detailed demo makers in China who has documented his creative journey. He mentioned in "My animation dream in high school in 2005

> I was actually qualified to get a guaranteed admission through animation, and one of the major triggers was also because I was upset that an animation I made in my junior year only won the third prize in the city. The earliest I learned flash, think some of them belong to not quite normal, not in line with the normal world of common sense, so I contacted the English 3dsMax in the pirated CD in the electronic technology market in Jinan, think that one is in line with the definition of the rules of the real physical world ...... gave up flash animation in junior high school and changed to 3D animation .
His record basically recovered the way that teenagers were exposed to computer animation from the late 90s to the early 2000s, and the education system consciously guided teenagers to computer animation by setting up various competitions, awards and guaranteed opportunities. However, it can be seen from Wang Xin's defense script that these competitions, which mainly focus on animation, mainly look at the technical specifications of the works and the ideology of the main theme, and do not require the contestants to have knowledge related to new media art.

## Sinicizers were probably the first group to be exposed to demos in China
So what was the path that allowed Yelio to access demos in 2001? I believe both the pirate software community and the Chineseization group may have played a role in this.

In the 1990s, due to low income and inconvenient cross-border transfers, there were almost no channels to buy genuine overseas software in China, and cracking became a mandatory course for domestic computer users. Gao Chunhui set up paulgao.com.cn, one of the earliest personal websites in China, whose initial content was based on cracking software, and earlier Gao Chunhui was also the moderator of the BBS software cracking page of Happy World of Northland. In 1998, he sold a series of software CDs through the Internet, including a special collection of PCSoft CD'1998 tHREE - WAREZ, which clearly shows that even if the domestic Internet community and the Warez community are not closely connected, they are at least aware of their existence.

In addition, Chinese translators play a very important role in the path of software distribution in China. The Chinese translators of multimedia software such as 3DS Max, Photoshop, Authorware, and Flash were probably also among the first domestic developers in digital media-related fields. There was a website called "Filter Chinese Room" in Yelio's Computing Art website, and its name showed that it focused on filters for various multimedia software, and almost all the Chinese patches for software provided corresponding registration codes or registrars.

Given the consumption level in China at that time, hardly any enthusiasts could afford to buy professional software that started at hundreds of dollars, and cracking and Chineseization were almost necessary for a software to be popular in China, so the Chineseization group played a role similar to that of the overseas voluntary piracy community (Warez) in China. The occasional demos that appear in the registrar's zip file are likely to have attracted their interest in the process of copying and Chineseization and to have spread in China, a point that can be corroborated by the fact that Warez teams like CORE and Razor191 are much better known in China than other demo teams that are not involved in cracking, CORE is a cracked version of Adobe Suite and Corel Painter and other multimedia production software crack team, while Razor1911 cracked popular games such as Half-Life and StarCraft.

## Introduction of Demo tools
farb-rausch Chinese synchronous mirror site is the earliest domestic enthusiasts to introduce the demo tool (demotool) website, probably established in 2003, its founder is then in Chengdu Medical College computer teaching and research department of Ren Wei, net name "three volts". In the "About" page of the website, he also recorded his feelings while watching the demo program.

> When we saw the animations, we were amazed that a small 64K could contain such beautiful animations and distortion-free music. Out of our passion and hobby, we created this .farb-rausch Chinese synchronous mirror site, hoping to bring these beautiful animations from Germany to more 3D animation lovers in the fastest time.
According to the information of the Chinese mirror site of farb-rausch, there were three members involved in the maintenance of the site, except for Frank, who is probably Ren Wei himself, and the remaining two participants, zxz and henry, whose identities cannot be determined yet.

The deputy webmaster mentioned in Frank's homepage "Frank's Studio", Zhou Qray (Qray, A-X) from Southwest Jiaotong University, may be the zxz mentioned in the farb-rausch Chinese synchronous mirror site. There is a big intersection between Chinese demo fans and Flash fans. Zhou Qirui's personal homepage "Qray Studio" shows a lot of pixelated images made by Flash, and he mentions in the homepage that "all these pixel drawings are made by me with my mouse", but he is also a multimedia developer. But he is also a multimedia software developer, and in the "My Designs" section, he provides his own WBMP editor and Qray character drawing master software.

As we can see, many of the groups that were able to study in depth the process of creating demos in the early 2000s, and to actively translate and disseminate them, were university students and teachers, with a distinctly collegial character.

## Sycini: An "Adventure" for Art Students
In early 2003, Studio XII was established at the Xu Beihong School of Art at Renmin University of China, with a focus on multimedia technology and art. In early 2005, some of the Studio 12 students formed the Sycini team, the first known team in China to consciously operate as a demo group.

The Sycini team describes their website as "the first resource site for Demoscene in China", but if we take into account the creation of the farb-rausch Chinese synchronous mirror site, and the dissemination of these works shared on the Yelio "Computational Art" website, we will be able to see how they have been distributed. However, if we take into account the creation of the farb-rausch Chinese synchronization mirror site, and the spread of these works shared on Yelio's "Art of Computing" website, Sycini may not be considered the "first" in terms of time. However, in terms of their philosophy and creative goals for the demoscene community, they were certainly among the first practitioners to have a more accurate understanding of the cultural connotations of the demoscene. Their goal is not only technical, but also cultural, i.e. "to accelerate the localization of demo and intro concepts".

One of the most important characteristics of Sycini is that they do not see the production of demos as a purely technical practice, but they are very aware of the artistic and cultural properties of demos, and they actively cooperate with the traditional, academic new media art field and seek exposure opportunities. For example, in May 2005, Sycini, founded only two months ago, participated in the first New Vision New Media Art Festival at the Beijing Film Academy, where it would connect itself to the contemporary art field by exhibiting on the same stage as video art. It also later included video content generated by the demo program in Beijing Santo Banner Drama Club's "6:3 II".

As a participant from an art faculty background, Sycini, while consciously disseminating their work through art exhibitions in a collegiate context, also attempted to gain theoretical legitimacy from the literature of new media art, as when they introduced the genetic art of artist Eduardo Kac, and the artificial art of Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau's Artificial Life Art, among others. They themselves have created scholarly essays to explain their understanding of new media art.

Sycini is also the only presentation team in China to have been featured in the mainstream media, having been featured in Computer Arts Digital Art magazine in July 2005. They were also written about in domestic academic journals. The article "Digital video art from real-time rendering video demos & intro" by Chen Peng and Fan Rong from Xi'an Polytechnic Institute was published in 2007 03 issue of Decoration magazine, which introduced some understanding of Demoscene in domestic academic circles at that time. The article regarded the demo work as a practice similar to integrated video work and The article regarded Demo works as a practice similar to integrated video works, and made an analogy with works in mainstream art exhibitions like the Venice Biennale. The only reference for this article is the Sycini team's website.

Some of the information in the article "Digital Video Art from Real-Time Rendering Demos & Intros" seems inaccurate, for example, it mentions that Sycini is "the first team in China that has participated in various Demoscene events". However, as far as we can see, Sycini has published its work through Pouet.net, but has not participated in any demo competitions. But even so, this article is still one of the closer to the demoscene in China. Later, some domestic scholars described Demoscene as "some computer experts also cracked and used the game's code to recreate a short trailer introducing the game content" (see "Video Game Research in Visual Culture Perspective"), which is obviously the opposite.

## Freedom from the limitations of Flash
Participants from artistic backgrounds, represented by the Sycini team, chose the demo tool as their creation tool largely just to get rid of the limitations of Flash's expressiveness. If we go to examine some of Sycini's works before 2005, we will find that works like Liu Chao's (Lauur) "Beijing Utopia" were made in Flash. But from its creation concept, it is already seen to be experimenting with procedural generation and other contents.

> This is an experiment of interactive music through free distribution, or free web download. (Figure e,f) The experiment's pure purpose is: how many results can be obtained in the hands of the author and in the hands of the viewer for a piece of music with a specified loop length and individual tones but without a specified bar order? Is it possible to obtain a formula such that (just hypothetically) the number of loops (A) times the number of tones (B) times the number of bars (C) equals a value (X)? This is the result if one of the values A, B, and C is an unknown or variable.

Starting from sy03.production in 2005, Sun Mo (sunnm0) and Ye Xiaohan (yxh) released a series of 64K demos using farb-rauch under the name of Sycini, which can be said to be the first batch of works in China that are on par with foreign demoscene in terms of creation concepts and methods. And this attempt did make their works present a completely different audio-visual experience from the popular Flash animation at that time.

Since I have not been able to get in touch with Sun Mo and Ye Xiaohan of Sycini, I can't describe the process of this transformation with any particular accuracy. But Wang Xin mentioned in a Zhihu answer (How did those 64k 3D animations achieve such a large compression rate?) In one of his answers (how did those 64k 3D animations achieve such a large compression rate?), he mentioned that what drove him to try making demos was his chance exposure to demos and their production tools, and his dissatisfaction with the quality of 3D animation in China at that time.

> I was in my first year of high school (2005), and after I was qualified to be admitted to the university by using the animation "Boldly Go" made in 3dmax, I was a bit bored with the complicated production process and the lossy compression quality, and happened to find a folder "Animation made by the world's top animation masters" (similar to this name) in the pirated CD "3dmax 5 English Edition" back then. exe (that is, the most famous fr-08), fire domain fantasy.exe, love memory.exe, etc..
One day, I found out that the production team was farbrausch in the end egg of fr-08, and later found the production tool: werkkzeug (Germany, abbreviation wz), and then used wz to create this animation (Seal of the Heart, kxxt).
> ......
> Also because of this, a senior student of mine decided to revitalize Chinese 3D animation, because Chinese 3D animation in 2005 was really unbearable. ( I can point out that one of the animation effects in the 2013 Spring Festival Gala was a direct particalillustion effect.) So I chose Tsinghua University School of Software. I hope I can make NB animation software and NB special effects. I do think that the Shen Liu launch animation in the cafeteria in high school is still rather frustrating.

Wang Xin's only public work, KXXT, is slightly larger (75.5KB) and not strictly a 64K demo, but again, it was made using farbrauch. Compared to pre-rendered animations, Wang Xin also points out that the benefit of demo works similar to Flash is the ability to achieve lossless high-definition animations on smaller file sizes and hardware resources. In 2005, high-definition videos above 720p still required almost the highest configuration of computers to handle, but many demo works can run smoothly at 1024x768 in ordinary configurations. resolution.

Compared to Sycini, who has a clearer explanation of his work from an experimental art perspective, middle-school-aged Wang Xin's motivation for his work is school romance. Although not quite the same as the competitive, showy creations of overseas creators, this socially motivated need to create shows the commonality of young digital content creators at home and abroad.

The content of KXXT also reveals the influence of Chinese pop music. For the most part, the creators of Demoscene tend to use original music rather than ripped versions of popular songs. However, in "KXXT" we can clearly identify the main melody of Guangliang's song "Fairy Tale".

## Developers who focus on program size
Compared to creators like the Sycini team and Wang Xin, who used demo tools with a creative goal more to escape the limitations of Flash animation expressiveness and explore richer forms of screen expression, participants from programmer backgrounds put more thought into size-coding techniques.

For example, Chen Shikai, another very early demo enthusiast and subsequent entrepreneur in the robotics field, created one of the earliest demo tutorials on the Internet in China. His 2006 modular music (Mod) tutorial was probably the first Tracker music production tutorial in China.

In 2008, near the end of the Sycini community, Shikai Chen compiled and summarized some tips on how to reduce the size of Visual C programs. However, as far as we can tell, Chen Shikai has not published any demos independently.

We will find that there seems to be a division among the participants of demo production activities in China: some people want to make content-rich, visually appealing demos, while others are obsessed with making the programs smaller. For example, dwing was one of the active demo authors in China at that time, but his more important work was the executable shelling software UPack/WinUPack, which was more closely connected to the Warez community. dwing's demos focused more on hard-coded size-coding, but had fewer image effects, and by today's standards can only be considered as a single effect demo. By today's standards, it can only be considered a one-effect demo.

In hindsight, the demo makers at the time were actually divided into two factions according to their motives for making the demos: whether the demoscene was a more technical or artistic affair was never agreed upon.

## The arrival of new trends and the lack of self-reflection
As we mentioned in the fifth lesson of this series, one of the key factors in the demoscene's ability to navigate through cycles of technological change and cultural trends to become the longest-standing digital cultural community is its self-reflective nature; even though demoscene participants are often technically savvy, they still maintain a cautious attitude toward technological trends. (Demoscene Platforms: A Case Study on the Adoption of Home Computers)

Many articles use terms such as "self-awareness," "self-reflection," and "self-sufficiency" when describing the European demo community. sufficient. Although there are community centers like Sycini in China, they are only information plazas that gather enthusiasts with different interests and backgrounds, but they do not form a community with self-awareness and self-reflection.

Soon after the emergence of Sycini, China began to intensively introduce new media creation methods and artists from overseas academic and commercial sectors. For example, in the 2006 Beijing New Media Art Exhibition and the 2007 Beijing Loud Exhibition, a number of artists presented content created by MAX/MSP. During the same period, domestic academic and commercial new media art-related technical communities also began to emerge. In addition to a few independent forums, the main gathering place for these enthusiasts was Douban.

In 2006, interactive-china.net was launched, in 2007, "processing learning group" and Arduino group appeared on Douban, and in 2008, VVVV, Max/Msp/Jitter, OpenFrameworks & Cider, etc. appeared on Douban. Their earliest work was actually similar to the farb-rausch Chinese synchronous mirror station, which translated overseas documents and teaching materials.

Compared to the demoscene, the evaluation criteria in the field of new media art are obviously less restrictive and more result-oriented. The "showy" part of the demoscene, such as size-coding, is considered to lack meaning, while the academic new media production tools have a lower barrier to entry, are better documented, and are not tied to the same anti-commercial hacker ideology as the demoscene, and are more likely to be used by traditional understood by contemporary art practitioners and commercial clients.

During this period, most of the participants who were interested in technology themselves, such as Wang Xin, Chen Shikai, and the more recently involved cjxgm, chose to work in the IT industry, and stayed away from demo production activities that lacked practical value. Students from artistic backgrounds who had played the role of organizers in the operation of Sycini turned almost without hesitation to collegiate production tools and did not reflect the prudence and skepticism of the demoscene in the face of the tools. Sometimes participants from technical backgrounds are "adopted" by the practices of the contemporary art scene, such as Chen Shikai's participation in the Shanghai Electronic Arts Festival in 2008, when he adopted Processing for the sake of development cycles. Although this "integration" was not entirely smooth, as Chen Shikai mentions in his exhibition experience that he had "a lot of complaints" about Processing, he also mentions the pressure of balancing daily work and creation as an amateur creator, "but since I was officially working in August, the time available was much less than expected. ".

Chen Shikai showed us a vivid example of collegiate new media production tools stealing potential participants from demo tools or other demoscene-style practices, somewhat like the Japanese scenario we mentioned in Session 9: the booming anime industry has developed ponderous creation rules before hobbyists are exposed to demoscene, which allows Japanese creators can more easily access the rules that are already in place whether they choose games or non-real-time animation, while demos that run in real-time but are not interactive are excluded from the ecosystem created by the anime industry.

In China, the best way to distribute real-time and non-interactive new media artworks is precisely through the academy's traditional new media art exhibitions. These exhibitions have some overlap between the expectations of the work and the presentation process; for example, they both value the presentation of visual effects, but technical elements of the demoscene that cannot be visually presented, such as the originality of the engine and the size of the program, are ignored. Such evaluation criteria actually encourage creators to abandon writing the underlying part of the program and focus on achieving more complex visual effects through the already existing engine.

## Post-2010: The boom of new media art and the absence of a demoscene
The public performance of Manabe Dadu in Beijing in 2009 showed the public nature of new media art, and the establishment of New Workshop in Shanghai in 2010 made new media art known to a community of creators influenced by "cottage" culture. At this point, computer graphics rendered in real time were localized in China, but not in the demoscene as Sycini had envisioned when it was founded, and the Chinese new media art community never brought with it the anti-commercial spirit and competitive atmosphere that characterized the demoscene.

However, even though many of the new media art enthusiasts of this period have entered the industrial and commercial world, their practice is not entirely meritocratic. But their practice was not entirely utilitarian either. Luo Xiao "Contra" and Zhang Jing "Vinjn", who participated in the same Shanghai Electronic Arts Festival as Chen Shikai, have run the hudo.it forum for a long time, and organized many new media art workshops and parties. OpenBook open source magazine has also published articles about new media production tools such as VVVV.

But the more this kind of non-Demoscene academic new media art flourishes, perhaps the less hope there is for a local demoscene in China that can communicate with the world, and even I am in a position to be "recruited".

At least a few conditions are needed for the demoscene to flourish, namely a high level of aesthetic education in society, a high computer penetration rate, a good level of social welfare, and a less prosperous investment climate. In the United States, where the academy and commercialized new media arts are thriving, there is likewise no thriving demoscene. Prosperous investment allows for great disparities in wealth among those with new media-related skills due to differences in hiring status, and in turn drives people into industry to earn a paycheck rather than participate in an altruistic, non-meritocratic scene.

## The Only Remaining Chinese Scener
But is there really no Scener left in China? I think China is at a stage where there is a Scener but not a Scene. First of all, some of the multinational companies' engineers who are expatriated to China may have a background in demo scenarios and introduce the corresponding knowledge to the domestic enthusiasts, one of the cases is EvilRyu, the only Chinese participant who still continues to participate in overseas competitions, who was a GPU engineer at ARM from He was introduced to the demoscene by Loaderror, a member of the Norwegian Ephidrena group, while working as a GPU engineer at ARM.

In addition to EvilRyu, other Chinese faces that can be found in the demoscene in recent years include TsanChungHsu, a Taiwanese engineer working in Wuhan, who uploaded a series of mod files he made of popular Chinese songs to ModArchive.

I had pinned my hopes in my 2018 article that the growth of creative programming in college curricula would foster more exposure to the demoscene, but now four years later I am more pessimistic: the commercialization of new media art is further squeezing the space for non-commercial scenes to thrive, and the financialized hype around creative content for artificial intelligence and digital currency is drawing more creators into the wave of profit-seeking.

I don't currently see an independent, self-aware and self-reflective demoscene emerging in China in the foreseeable future, but it may be possible to take some cues from Demoscene, as I mentioned in my last session, demo parties, competitions and live performances could all find their way into China as part of cultural tourism and cultural industries. At the same time, the demonstration scene, as intangible cultural heritage of several countries, might be recognized by the government and the academy in the process of international cultural exchange. This would be a bit like the gentrification of other cultural communities with grassroots origins, as skateboarding and graffiti have experienced.

# Digital culture as cultural heritage

This talk is the final session of the demoscene Introduction: Digital Art Communities as Cultural Heritage. In this session, I would like to talk about why we need to consider digital culture phenomenon as a cultural heritage, and how the demoscene is the first digital culture phenomenon and digital culture community in the world to impact intangible cultural heritage.

If we do some simple searches on the internet, we can probably see how big the gap is between domestic and foreign knowledge on the topic of "demoscene": if we search on Bilibili for the keyword "World If we search on Bilibili for a keyword like "World Programming Contest", you will find many videos with a high number of views, but we can already see through this course that most of the entries are more than 10 years old in the demoscene, and the audience is still focused on the size of the program, but does not care about the latest progress of the production technology in the scene. The audience is still focused on the size of the program, but not on the latest advances in production techniques.

The first eleven classes of the semester contain a range of information that reflects the latest changes in the demoscene. Many of the points were mentioned for the first time in China, and it was a breakthrough from the original stereotype of demoscene as "world programming competition" and "64K animation", and a synchronization with the understanding of demoscene by overseas participants and researchers.

We were able to learn that what is widely misunderstood in China as the "World Programming Contest" or "Hacker Programming Contest" is in fact a demonstration called "demo compo". Today's demo competitions are not only focused on programming, but also on size-coding, which focuses on the size of the program, but are a series of comprehensive competitions of electronic, programming, and performance skills related to multimedia technology.

A demo contest is part of a larger gathering of technology enthusiasts, a "demo party", which involves a series of hardware creators such as 3D printers, robots, LED lighting fixtures, etc. in a modern demo party, but also It also includes retro computing activities such as hardware modification and software development of old computers. Today's demo party is a multi-cultural gathering of computing, and the competition is only one aspect of it.

## Progress of the demoscene bid
The demoscene is receiving some special attention in recent years, a major reason being the recognition by several European countries of the demoscene as an intangible cultural heritage of that country. Finland was the first country to recognize the demoscene as intangible cultural heritage, and in April 2020 the Finnish Heritage Agency inscribed the demoscene on Finland's national intangible cultural heritage list.

The second country to inscribe the demoscene as intangible cultural heritage is Germany, where the Standing Conference of Ministers of Education and Culture in March 2021 inscribed the demoscene In March 2021, the Standing Conference of the German Ministers of Education and Culture inscribed the demoscene on the German Intangible Cultural Heritage. This was followed by Poland in December 2021, when the demoscene was inscribed on the national ICH list.

This series of events shows that the demoscene is breaking through its underground status of "subculture" and becoming a cultural heritage recognized by mainstream society, which not only challenges the national stereotype of the demoscene as a "niche", but also gives us a huge cultural impact. This not only challenges the national stereotype of the demoscene as "niche", but also gives us a huge cultural shock that even in today's highly developed Internet, a cultural phenomenon as digitally native, influential and recognized by the mainstream society is still unknown and misunderstood in China. This makes it clear that we should not believe that "the Internet can bridge the cultural divide", but rather look more curiously at the cultural differences that are still widespread and even widening in the digital age.

## Efforts to Inherit the European Scene
The most important force demonstrating the legacy of the scene is the Art-of-Coding initiative. It was launched by the European Federation of Video Game Archive Museums and Preservation (EFGAMP) together with the Digitale Kultur e.V. digital culture association (e.V. is the German word for registered association).

A very detailed FAQ about the initiative on the programmed art website gives the background to the whole thing. Digitale Kultur e.V is also the organizer of Evoke, the most active demo party at the moment. In addition, the Polish Demoscene Chronicles association, the French digital heritage preservation agency MO5.com, and the Danish Royal Library's digital cultural heritage department are also involved in demo-related inscriptions.

Thanks to the efforts of the above-mentioned parties, the demoscene has been successfully granted intangible cultural heritage status in the three European countries mentioned above, and with applications in other countries in progress, I believe that in the future the demoscene is likely to become a world-class intangible cultural heritage that will enter UNESCO.

## UNESCO's inscription process
So what is the process of inscription of the demoscene? The process is slightly different in each country: Germany needs to apply for a non-regional intangible heritage first, and then for a national one, while Finland In Finland, a Wiki article has to be prepared first, and then a report is submitted on the basis of this article. Generally speaking, the national level is the main threshold for application, and when a cultural phenomenon becomes a national cultural heritage, it becomes eligible to be submitted by the host country to UNESCO for inclusion in the World Intangible Cultural Heritage List.

With more than two countries currently listing the demonstration scene as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, the demonstration scene becomes a transnational application, requiring additional coordination efforts, which is currently the main task of EFGAMP and Digitale Kultur e.V. mentioned above. Of course, the more countries involved in the application, the better the chances of success in the UNESCO ICH list.

For the time being, the main goal of the European demo community is still the national application, and it will take UNESCO about two years to complete the examination of the application for inclusion in the World Intangible Cultural Heritage List, if the transnational application is successfully launched.

The Art-of-Coding website has made available a series of materials related to the German and Finnish applications, including many papers, news articles and videos of presentations, and they also provide a discord channel for interested participants to interact. interested participants to interact.

## "Heritage" is not just about old things
But there may be some questions about what makes the demoscene "non-heritage," especially since there is a stereotype in China that non-heritage is almost always equated with something ancient. There is a huge gap between digital culture, pop culture and popular culture, as if only things that are no longer popular and are in danger of being passed on are considered non-heritage in the domestic context. This stereotype comes from the fact that the contemporary aspect of ICH has long been neglected in the domestic discussion and practice of ICH.

UNESCO's definition of intangible cultural heritage in fact emphasizes the contemporary dimension. If we look at UNESCO's "What is Intangible Cultural Heritage" website, we will find that the first description of ICH is

> Traditional, contemporary, but also living: ICH represents not only the inherited traditions of the past, but also contemporary rural and urban practices in which different cultural groups participate.
The contemporary and living nature of ICH is a point that is often overlooked in the current discussion of "ICH" in the Chinese context. I think this is a concept that we should update in particular.

But if we look further into the definition of ICH in the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, we can see that the Convention does not emphasize "long history", but rather adaptation and interaction with the environment, and "continuous re-creation".

"Intangible cultural heritage" refers to the social practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills, and associated tools, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals, consider as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage is passed on from generation to generation and is constantly recreated as communities and groups adapt to their surroundings and interact with nature and history, providing them with a sense of identity and continuity and thus enhancing respect for cultural diversity and human creativity.
Therefore, it is clear that "non-heritage" is not something that is considered fixed, frozen, or locked up, but rather a practice that is constantly being created and changed. This is also the misconception of NRM conservation in China, which overemphasizes the obsession with repairing the old, practicing the ancient, and "ancient methods" and "authentic", while ignoring the aspect of cultural heritage re-creation. Frozen cultural symbols clearly do not provide communities with a sense of identity and continuity, and the overemphasis on "authenticity" lacks respect for diversity and creativity.

By reconceptualizing UNESCO's interpretation of "non-heritage," we have, in part, explained the reasons why digital cultural phenomena, such as demonstration scenes, which make extensive use of computer technology, have become non-heritage. The German application, which is the most publicly available, explains in more detail how the demoscene meets UNESCO's requirements for an NPL.

## Overview of the German application file
The application file for Germany, which is publicly available on the Art-of-Coding website, begins with a description of how to categorize the cultural heritage of the items under application, which is required for applications by UNESCO in Germany, using five keyword groups to summarize the characteristics of the cultural activities included in the application.

> Subgroup A: traditions and expressions passed down orally
> Keywords: own technical vocabulary, own idioms and terminology, English as a common language
> Subgroup B: Performing arts (music, theater, dance)
> Keywords: program composition (composition), performers, live, public presentation, animation
> Subgroup C: social traditions, (seasonal) celebrations and rituals
> Keywords: presentation gatherings, contests, visitor voting, award ceremonies
> Subgroup D: knowledge and customs related to nature or the universe
> Keywords: digital living environment, cyberspace, virtual reality
> Subgroup E: traditional crafts
> Key words: programming, composition, animation, adoption (adoption), do-it-yourself DIY

Through the previous eleven lessons, we basically covered all the above topics, for example, we were exposed to a series of technical terms for demo scenarios such as demo party (demo party), demo competition (demo compo), wild demo (wild demo), etc. Most of the current demo scenarios I have done most of the Chinese translations of the terminology of the demoscene. For example, the translation of Demoscene into "performance scene" by some people before is not particularly intuitive, because similar terms with it will be written in full as "electro scene", "hip-hop scene "Therefore, the translation of Demoscene as "demoscene" is the most appropriate, which can be directly associated with the scene of various music styles gathered together.

We have mentioned the demoscene as an aspect of the performing arts, especially in wild demo productions, many of which can themselves be classified as some form of stage performance, such as light shows or musical performances. The most typical case of the demoscene as a part of celebration and ritual is the demo parties we talked about in Lesson 10, many of which have been going on for over 30 years and have influenced the shape of many different computer technology parties.

Demoscene have their own traditional craft, which includes many aspects of programming, composition, animation, etc. This craft is not abstract, but closely related to the adaptation and utilization of computer platforms.

And a very interesting point is the interpretation of the demoscene as a knowledge and custom related to nature or the universe. For the demoscene, the knowledge related to the environment it presents is one of the biggest changes in human living space in the last 50 or 60 years, namely the emergence of digital living environments, cyberspace and virtual reality.

Although cyberspace and virtual reality are "virtual", the transformation of our living environment by digitalization is real, and it happened before the commercialization of the Internet, such as the electronicization of banking, postal services, transportation and other utilities, the emergence of video games, etc. An example is the Minitel terminal in France, which is not part of the Internet but realized online shopping, social networking and other functions before the Internet, and the process of human use of digital technology is itself a process of adaptation to the environment.

The demoscene, however, has witnessed the entire process of digitization and has spanned almost all the important technological changes. In the fourth section, we talked about many old computers that are closely related to the demoscene, whether it is the old 8-bit computers such as ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64, or the old 16-bit computers such as Amiga and Atari ST, on which rich demo works were born. Also the demo scenarios we mentioned in session 5 reacted in the face of PC hardware changes, showing the interaction between the community and the technology and business environment.

## Digital Heritage
In addition to the demoscene community itself as intangible cultural heritage, the works generated by the demoscene constitute another heritage of humanity as defined by UNESCO, namely digital heritage. When we discuss the heritage of the demoscene, we are actually talking about the dual heritage of intangible cultural heritage and digital heritage.

In 2003, UNESCO proposed a Charter for the Preservation of Digital Heritage, which specifically refers to "original digital resources", i.e., "no other form than digital. " The Charter also refers to digital resources "in their original form. The Charter also mentions that digital resources "generally do not exist for long and require deliberate production, maintenance and management in order to be preserved. Most of these resources have enduring value and significance and are therefore a heritage to be protected and preserved for present and future generations."

Although digital resources such as "software and web pages" are mentioned among the digital resources mentioned in the Charter, the practice of preserving such resources is still in a relatively preliminary stage. Most digital libraries currently rely on the preservation of software on storage media such as CD-ROMs, but lack appropriate preservation mechanisms for shareware and freeware that are not on physical media and are distributed via the Internet. More often than not, libraries and archives establish digital content repositories to preserve the digital content of non-digital content rather than the digital native content, and digital content is regarded as a means to preserve non-digital content rather than the object of preservation, with typical cases such as digitization of ancient books, digitization of audio recordings, digitization of architecture, and so on.

But the preservation of native digital heritage is a real challenge for today's world, as the process of digitization has produced many technologies that are quickly considered obsolete. Flash animation, for example, is a technology that has gone from being widely used to being considered obsolete in just over a decade.

Most of the mainstream web browsers today can no longer open Flash animations, but many enthusiasts, including myself, have made or learned Flash software at some point and understand some Flash animation techniques. Flash is also an important part of the development of Rich Media on the web, bringing many new concepts and practice paradigms to web interaction, and its popularity has directly influenced the shape of today's HTML5 Canvas animations and web games. 

The short life of Flash animation demonstrates that this dynamic process of digital culture formation is largely driven by private companies whose business logic prefers to sell new products rather than focus on the preservation and maintenance of old ones, an attitude that is obliterating the culture. There are many examples of this, such as the iOS software store where many games developed for 32-bit devices can no longer be downloaded and run.

In addition to technically blocking older software to prevent communities from running it, private companies sometimes actively pursue legal avenues to oppose the preservation of outdated digital culture products by enthusiasts and institutions, such as when one of the largest video game companies, Nintendo, once sued an old game download site back in 2018 and won, which caused almost all of the more serious digital culture and video game archiving institutions to stop providing Nintendo with 's game ROMs for public access, including the Console Living Room section of the Internet Archive, which offers an online experience of older games, has circumvented the inclusion of games from Nintendo.

As a result of the uncooperative attitude of private companies in preserving digital heritage, this leads to the loss of meaning and functionality of the software code written for these systems when the historical hardware and software gradually fail and we will lose access. 

This is already a fairly obvious problem today, and these problems are likely to get worse in the future. Many of today's video games and even applications operate on a SaaS-like basis, allowing users to "rent" a specific account on a specific device. Once the relevant developers go out of business or no longer to continue to maintain these services, the corresponding software will be invalid, and more difficult to be restored.

Sony launched the VR social platform PlayStation Home on the Playstation 3 platform in 2008, very much like the "meta-universe" platform sold by many Internet platform companies today, which ran for seven years after its launch in 2008 and was taken offline in 2015. We can imagine the vast amount of user-generated content on PlayStation Home, such as clothing and furniture in virtual spaces, and the difficulty of archiving and restoring them is clearly higher than for games installed on PC hard drives.

I believe that today's digital media researchers, especially those sensitive to digital heritage, should be sensitive to the commercial "metaverse". They should be wary of commercial "metaverse" companies. Sony, an evergreen in the gaming industry, has been around for 30 years, from the first PlayStation in the early 90s to now, and still cannot guarantee a platform for the long run, and those companies that track the wind are obviously even less likely. How much of the content created during the VR mania of 2015 to 2017 can we still recover today? With all the VR glasses and 3D monitors we can find on Salty, such as the Storm Magic Mirror, Super Multi-Dimensional 3Dbox, etc., how much of the content on these platforms still has a chance of being re-experienced by people? Obviously this challenge exists all around us.

PlayStation Home is fortunate that some enthusiasts overseas have organized the Destination Home program to restore some of PlayStation Home's features and content, but for these domestic platforms, once its operators mismanage the platform and shut it down, we may lose access to that content forever.

This competition between preservation and abandonment continues, and in 2018, UNESCO pushed through the Paris Call: Software Source Code as a Heritage for Sustainable Development, calling on countries to protect software code as the heritage of humanity. We find that even 15 years after the Charter for the Preservation of Digital Heritage, the preservation of software, the most important digital native content, remains an under-recognized and often neglected element.


> However, software is often neglected and its preservation is at risk. Until recently, the source code of software was not stored in a reliable archive, but was offline, not available to the public, or stored on working platforms that might one day disappear. The problem of preserving software is compounded by the failure to recognize it as a unique form of human knowledge, a creative expression of problem solving, and a part of our heritage. Software is fragile.

At the same time, while software source code is the direct expression of human intellectual work on digital systems, executable binary programs are equally human creations that deserve to be organized and preserved as long as source code.

## The "intergenerational transmission" of digital culture
As noted above, digital heritage has a much shorter shelf life, and the reasons for its unavailability are not only human, but also influenced by technological developments and commercial activities. These challenges make the conditions necessary for the "intergenerational transmission" of digital culture different from those of other types of cultural phenomena. 

On page 3 of the German application, it is stated that digital culture is short-lived and highly dependent on technological platforms, and that its life cycle is much shorter than that of human beings.

> With regard to the multigenerational transmission of culture, we must recognize that the definition of "intergenerational" in the digital cultural space is different from the traditional context, where cultural heritage is transmitted between (human) generations. On the other hand, digital cultural forms tend to be short-lived because they are inherently dependent on technological platforms and develop in specific contexts.
Even for our same generation, we are already experiencing the loss of certain digital cultural content due to the unavailability of technological conditions. Like the Flash I mentioned, it is currently more difficult to access than it was a decade or so ago, but can still be configured for use on contemporary computers. But it is possible that in another 10 years our computers will no longer be able to run Flash, just as many computers today can no longer run software directly under DOS.

For me this change has already happened, for example, the first animation software I ever used, Animator Pro, was a DOS program, and if the community hadn't developed better DOS emulators like DOSBox, we probably wouldn't have been able to continue to access this historic, groundbreaking animation software. Its developer, Jim Kent, retained the rights to its source code and made the main program open source in 2009, giving it the possibility of being ported to new platforms. However, there is still a large amount of software that is on the verge of being inaccessible.

Thanks to Demoscene, much of the knowledge related to older computer platforms, especially 8-bit computers such as the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum, has been largely preserved, but there are still many computer devices that cannot continue to function due to the discontinuity of related knowledge.

Digital heritage is often more demanding than non-digital heritage, and may be inaccessible before a generation is aware of its inheritance crisis: customized Qzone, Renren homepages, or games developed on Wenquixing, for example, are all part of the digital heritage of our generation, but few people are aware of it. 

The demoscene community, which preserves a large number of digital works and practices, is thus considered "the cornerstone of a 30-year-old digital culture and one of the few communities that have been able to maintain their cultural identity through several technological milestones" (German heritage submission, p. 3).

## Based on mashups and migrations and legacies
In section 5 of the Introduction to the demoscene we mentioned the reaction of the demoscene in the face of technologized change: the scene's acceptance of new platforms and technologies is neither total nor unreserved, but is accompanied by intense controversy and discussion of progressive acceptance. This introspective debate allows the demoscene to embrace new technologies while maintaining the continuity and identity of its own community.

An important practice for the demoscene to maintain its legacy is the mixing and rearranging of established content. For example, Second Reality, one of the most iconic works in the demoscene, is one of the most reworked works in the scene. Its original version was based on a 486-level PC, and enthusiasts in the demoscene explored it meaningfully in both new and old directions, with the work being ported to the much older Commodore 64 computer in 1997 and, after the new millennium, to the mixed reality capabilities of smartwatches, holographic displays, and smartphones.

Another example is the 1992 Amiga computer demo program State of Art, whose iconic silhouette dance images were recreated in 2021 as a laser projection on top of a barn outside of Montreal (State of Laser Beam). This attempt at "mashups" shows that the demoscene is not bound to "authenticity" or exclusive content exclusivity, but is open to the freedom of the community to evolve and allow content and cultural symbols to break through the boundaries of the platform to be retained in a rapidly changing technological world. The demoscene was born early to preserve itself.

The demoscene developed an early sense of preserving its digital cultural heritage. Statistics on the demoscene's largest comprehensive website, pouet.net, show that it has over 88,000 archived works, over 13,000 production groups, over 1,300 demo parties and over 4,300 discussion forums and BBSs. The works are collected and organized as early as 2000, while the release time of the works can be traced back to the early 80s.

In addition to comprehensive archive sites like pouet.net, the demoscene also has a number of enthusiasts who maintain categorized sites, such as the Mod Archive, which holds over 25,000 music files created using Tracker track sampling sequences. The site also keeps a lot of metadata about the work itself, such as author information, style of music, etc. A similar preservation site dedicated to a particular category of activity in the demoscene is demoparty.net, which organizes a large amount of information related to demo parties.

While the demoscene is a native digital community, it also generates a lot of non-digital material, such as letters, flyers, posters, etc., which is also organized and protected by enthusiasts in the demoscene. The Papers website has preserved a lot of paper materials related to the demoscene, and even some handwritten notes from demo parties are well preserved. This thorough archiving is evidence that the demoscene is considered its cultural heritage by the community to which it belongs. 

## Conclusion and insights
That's about it for today's presentation of the heritage of the demoscene. Perhaps what is important in discussing the demoscene as an intangible cultural heritage at this point in time is not so much the knowledge of the event itself, but the inspiration that can be drawn from it in terms of understanding digital culture. 

The demoscene shows us a tension in digital culture, a tension that is reflected in the resilience of the digital culture to which the community belongs in the face of technological change. The industry actively encouraged the young computer users of the time to acquire programming skills, and in that atmosphere programming was considered a very important part of universal computer education.

After the 1990s, however, the focus of computer education shifted to teaching the use of finished commercial software such as Photoshop and MS Office, and programming languages became a skill that only a few people could master. Faced with the challenges of these changes, the demoscene has actively reinvented itself while retaining its cultural core.

As mentioned in Session 5, the demoscene has faded into the new millennium as an elitist community of programming-savvy multimedia hackers, and has become more open-minded to tools with lower barriers to entry, such as Processing, and has embraced new participants through events such as the Imageathon and new competition categories. We are open to new participants through events like the Imageathon and new competition categories. This flexibility is something that we tend to lose in our domestic climate.

And secondly, the demoscene shows what can be achieved with digital culture, especially non-commercial folk digital culture, which I think is a very important point. For the current situation in China, digital culture has been developed for a relatively short period of time, while commercial forces entered very early, and there is a huge gap between those forces and those of the private sector, so that grassroots, non-commercial, non-academic, non-utilitarian digital culture creations are scarce and unappreciated.

However, there are clearly such folk communities of digital culture in China, and the "flash mob" is a good example, but the internal and external environment limits the heights it can reach. Digital culture can even include content that has not traditionally been considered cultural creation, such as the personal pages of Qzone and Renren, which were once highly customizable, even though they did not have a clear creative theme, but reflected a distinct cultural identity. The output of this content relied on online platforms controlled by large commercial companies, while domestic enthusiasts did not develop a sense of preserving their own cultural heritage, which has now disappeared in large numbers.

European enthusiasts have shown us the fact that the achievements of non-commercial folk digital culture and digital art are comparable to many traditional cultural forms. The successful inscription of demoscene in several European countries provides a model for digital culture preservation and interpretation of digital culture, and the study of demoscene allows us to re-examine our own attitudes toward digital culture and digital heritage.

The last point, which is also of particular relevance, is that the demoscene provides us with a new way of thinking about cultural exchange in the direction of the Belt and Road. In mid-June, Chongqing hosted the 13th Hungarian Cultural Festival in Western China, and Hungary is one of the European countries where the demoscene has flourished, with Hungarian enthusiasts participating in demo production activities as early as 1986, and the most detailed book documenting the reality of the scene, "Freax: The Brief History of the Demoscene", was written by Hungarian researchers. Freax: The Brief History of the Demoscene" was also completed by Hungarian researcher Tamas Polgar. Heavyweight demo events such as the Function Demo Party and demo production teams such as Conspiracy have also come from Hungary. There are also active demoscene communities in Serbia, Greece, and other European countries. 

At present, there is a significant gap between the number of participants and the quality of work in digital culture in China and Europe. We should consider the possible role of demoscene in digital culture exchange when developing cultural exchange between China and Europe. I also hope that one day we will see more digital art enthusiasts engaging and participating in the demoscene, which is a very interesting and cool international digital art community.

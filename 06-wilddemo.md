# "wild" demo
Today is the sixth session of the Introduction to Presentation Scenarios, "wild demo". What is wild demo and what is its history? The purpose of the wild demo is simply summarized in a quote from the Finnish Assembly Party's Wild demo primer from 2002.

> The original purpose of the wild compo was to provide a category for entries done on platforms not accepted in the normal compos.
> The original purpose of the wild compo was to provide a category for entries done on platforms not accepted in the normal compos.

Wild demos are obviously distinctly different from the careful categorization and detailed rules that characterize demo competitions in general. A typical demo compo usually has a detailed classification of computer platform specifications, such as a category for Commodore 64, a category for PC, a category for Amiga, and so on. However, there are always many computer models that the organizers are unable to provide, some of which are niche models or have few developers, such as the TI-99 series; there are also some models that have distinct regional characteristics and are entered across borders, such as domestic learning machines and electronic dictionaries. These models often cannot find a suitable category to participate in because of the differences in machine performance and development tools, and the demo programs developed for them are difficult to compare directly with Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in a horizontal manner.

But curiosity about the hardware platform itself is one of the core values of the demo scene, and hobbyists often expect to see some strange hardware devices, so a new category has emerged to accommodate these entries that cannot be placed in a specific competition category: the "wild" demos.

## The scope of "wild" is variable
"The range of entries accepted into the "wild" demo is very vague, and usually any entry that cannot be found in the appropriate category at the party can be entered as wild. The primary criterion for determining whether an entry is "wild" is whether it can be found in the appropriate category at the party it wishes to enter. For example, some contests accept consoles as platforms for entry, while others do not. At parties that accept consoles, demo programs made for consoles can be entered in the appropriate category, usually in the category of old or new computers, but at parties that do not accept consoles, they can only be entered in the wild category.

For example, the Assembly Party in Finland includes Playstation 2/3, Xbox, Sega Dreamcast and other consoles in the "desktop" category, and allows entries from these platforms to compete in the 64KB Intro, 4K Intro and other categories. It also allows entries written in Java. However, the Revision Party in Germany only allowed console platforms in the OldSkool competition, and PC platforms could neither include consoles nor allow entries written in Java. In this case, some of the entries that could be included in the appropriate category at Assembly Party would have to be entered in the "wild" category at Revision Party.

Another situation is that some devices are difficult to define as "old" or "new", for example, the Raspberry Pi is much more powerful than a typical OldSkool computer: it is a typical 32-bit system, often with 512MB of RAM or more. But it is particularly weak compared to typical newer computers. However, the Raspberry Pi hardware is one of the most popular development boards available, and even currently sells more than the Commodore 64, which holds the record for sales of a single computer, so there is no shortage of creations on the Raspberry Pi platform, at which point the Raspberry Pi or similar creations on development boards face the same problem of classification. At the Demosplash gathering at Carnegie Mellon University, it was specifically mentioned that the Arduino could be entered in the "Modern" category, so the Raspberry Pi could be entered under this rule by analogy, but more often than not, work created on a development board would be classified as "Wild" category.

## Starting point for the "wild": video work in scenes
If we were to trace the origins of the "wild" category in the demo scene, most participants would agree that the earliest wild demos were the non-real-time rendered video and animation works created by the demo scene participants.

As we mentioned in the first session, the core activity of the demo scene is the production of a series of executable computer programs called "demos," a rule that generally excludes non-real-time rendered video content and serves to distinguish "demos" from the broader category of digital and experimental video. This rule generally excludes non-real-time rendered video content, and is the most obvious boundary that distinguishes "demos" from digital and experimental video works in a broader sense.

This does not mean, however, that participants in the presentation scene will refuse to produce work that is not generated in real time. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) has many technical similarities to executable real-time presentations, so some non-real-time generated animations and videos are also distributed and presented by enthusiasts at presentation gatherings. And some of these non-real-time running works get the opportunity to be entered, and as the number of such works increases, the organizers of the gatherings start to try to add new categories to them.

Doreen Hartmann, a scholar at the University of Paderborn (Germany), published a paper in 2014, "Animation in the Demoscene. From Obfuscation to Category), which provides a more systematic introduction to animation in the demo scene, mentions that it is acceptable to include some pre-rendered effects as a performance-optimizing "blindfold" even in a demo program running in real time.

> Knowing these technical and historical facts, one might assume that Demoscene's real-time principle precludes animation. But this is not the case. Animation has been part of the Demoscene almost from the beginning, and it appears in different forms, as previous Demoscene studies have pointed out. For example, early Demosceners already deceived their audience with animated graphics that were pre-calculated in the background while other effects were displayed (see Reunanen 2010, 47 and Leonard 2006), or with effects that were only calculated once and then played as animations. Especially on the Amiga 500/OCS in the late 80s and early 90s, this loop structure was commonly used without objection by the participants of the scene (cf. Botz 2011, 293).

One work that is credited with really putting Wild Demo on the map was Global Trash 2, presented by The Silents group at The Party gathering in Denmark in 1991. although it was not a program that ran in real time on a computer, it demonstrated many of the leading CGI animation effects of the time, and thus received high praise from enthusiasts in the demo scene It was highly praised by enthusiasts in the demo scene and prompted the demo scene to create a new "wild" category to accept such work. In the introduction to the work, it reads.


> Global Trash II has been presented at various computer conferences throughout Europe and has been shown several times on MTV Europe. Global Trash II was the first video demo to break into the demo scene, setting a new standard for demos and video.

At the time of Global Trash II's appearance in 1991, there was no digital home video distribution path like Video CD or DVD, so it was distributed at parties as a VHS tape.

Features of ## Demoscene video works
If we examine each shot in Global Trash II carefully, we will see that it has many effects that are common in demo programs of the same period, such as rotating 3D models, continuously generated light bars, smoke effects, etc. The article "From Confusion to Classification" actually summarizes some of the characteristics of the video-imaging type of work that appears in Demoscene.

### Highlighting visual effects rather than narrative
It mentions that one of the common creative techniques in Demoscene animations is the use of non-programmed, simulation-based means to mimic the effects of the demo program, and notes that the video work in the demo scenes does not emphasize the narrative nature of the video.

> Experimental geometry, abstract forms or typography, and the (sometimes fictional) physical laws of these elements seem to be essential elements of many Demoscene animations. Many Demoscene animations use classic demonstrative effects to "win the heart" of the viewer, as illustrated by Gaspode's stop-motion work. In his work, he takes the theme of presentation effects and reconstructs them in simulation (see Noodles (2010) or Sugar Shock (2013)). These works are very popular in the scene, naturally for self-aware reasons. In contrast, computer-generated works outside of Demoscene and digital film works put the focus on storytelling.

In the 2010 work Noodles, for example, we can see that the author of the video uses a variety of noodles to create a stop-motion animation in which he imitates a large number of images that are common in real-time generated demo scenes, and you will see that it actually has a lot of images that are representative of this Demoscene style: spinning cubes, bouncing balls, and imitations of computer program loading progress bar.

### Sound and image synaesthesia
However, the text goes on to argue that it is not only works that mimic the effects of real-time image generation that are accepted by the demo scene, but that the core criterion for the evaluation of video by the demo scene is the synchronization of audio and visual effects, i.e., synaesthesia.

> On the contrary, another aspect of successful presentation animation seems to play a role in this case: the synchronization of audio and visual effects. This is perhaps the most central evaluation criterion, which is not surprising since it is also a major aspect of real-time presentations.JCO's animation work "A Visual Approach to Sampling Aesthetics" (2013) can be used as an example.

The Visual Approach to the Aesthetics of Sampling, cited in the text, is a relatively recent work, and the creative approach in it can be traced directly back to the 2002 Visual Approach To The Aesthetics Of Techno Aesthetics Of Techno)

### Following a non-commercial hacking ethic
One of the features of the demo scene animations also mentioned in From Obfuscation to Classification is non-commercial.

> Another characteristic is the non-commercial nature, the animation must be done only for that scene - thus the animation follows the overall Demoscene "ethic". This also marks a major difference from other CGI festivals, such as the Ars Electronica Animation Festival, where commercial work is voted alongside amateur work.

## Real Time Wild
After the emergence of the "wild" category in the demo scene, the video video category had been the most important and most numerous segment of the "wild" work, but in the early 2000s, some demo party organizers found that the popularity of video work The computer-centric nature of the presentation scene has been undermined.

> Unfortunately, more recently wild demos have increasingly become home video demos with work that has nothing to do with computers. While many of these productions are undoubtedly quite humorous, and even quite well done, the large number of home videos has kept computer-generated productions out of the finals. Wild demo primer (Assembly Party, 2002)

And in response to this change, the contest organizers have adjusted the rules for entry to give higher weight to computer-generated entries

> ...... For example, last year's wild demo on a Nokia 9210 communicator is a good example of a truly wild demo.
> ......
> This year, in order to bring the Wild Demo competition closer to its original purpose, computer-generated entries will be given an advantage in the judging process, and the competition organizers reserve the full right to exclude low-quality entries from the competition. Wild demo primer (Assembly Party, 2002)

The entry on the Nokia 9210 communicator mentioned in the text is the Pygmy Projects entry G-Force 2001, the first smartphone after the operating system formerly known as EPOC was renamed Symbian, and the first Nokia Series 80 device. G-Force 2001 follows the general characteristics of other types of demos: it is released as an executable and generates images and sound effects in real time; the biggest difference with other demos is that it runs on an alternative platform: the Nokia 9210, as a device only launched in the summer of 2001, obviously cannot be classified as an Oldskool platform, but as a mobile device, it has a large performance gap with desktop PCs. As a mobile device, it has a large performance gap with desktop PCs, so this type of work can only be entered into the demo competition as a "wild" category.

In order to distinguish such programmed and real-time works from general animation works, these works are often called "real-time wild" (real wild) or "real wild" (real wild) demo.

## Integration with electronic DIY culture
The encouragement of real-time wild work in the demo scene in the 2000s brought about a passion among demo scene enthusiasts to design a variety of demo installations and became an important intersection between the demo scene and the electronic DIY culture. A series of these works inherited some effects of real-time category demo works and reproduced them using atypical computer hardware and homemade devices.

For example, the 2003 work LED megademo uses a display device that is a 20×4 LCD monitor, its code runs on PC hardware and Linux systems, and mimics some common effects on PC demos, such as scrolling subtitles and rotating cube animations. But by utilizing a different display device, it creates a significantly different audio-visual experience than the computer monitor.

There is another common alternative display device in the demo scene is the oscilloscope. The 2007 work Youscope is probably the first oscilloscope work shown in the demo scene, which utilizes the X-Y mode of the oscilloscope for drawing and uses the computer sound card as the signal source, and the left and right channels of the computer sound card output the X-axis and Y-axis signals respectively to achieve the drawing animation. The demonstration using an oscilloscope as the display device was followed by many more appearances in the demonstration scene, and a list was compiled by enthusiasts specifically to collect a series of similar works.

Another type of common platform in wild demonstrations is the MCU (Micro Controller), or microcontroller. A series of microcontroller-related works have been compiled on the website of Swedish musician Linus Åkesson (lft), who is also one of the engineers at Swedish synthesizer manufacturer Teenage Engineering.

One of them, The Hardware Chiptune Project, was published in 2007 and showed that instead of using any existing sound chip, the AVR could be programmed to achieve a sound chip-like musical effect.

And in 2008 Linus published a more complex work called "Craft", using ATmega88 microcontroller to realize not only the music effect but also the dynamic image output through VGA interface.

There are many other wild demonstrations using microcontrollers, for example, the ESP8266, which is commonly used in these years to make various WiFi-related IoT devices, was presented at the Demosplash party in 2017, and the ESPTV, which uses the ESP8266 to generate TV signals, won the "Free Video" category that year. "category.

The use of LED lighting devices in the 2000s also appeared in the wild demo competition, and Hey ho, led's go! using a homemade LED device won second place in the wild category at the Kindergarden 2008 party in Norway. The first place was awarded to a non-real time animated entry because of the mix of real time and non-real time competitions in the "wild" category at that gathering.

In the 2010s, LED light installations are still an important part of wild demo creations, and the first place wild demo in Revision 2015 was a programmable light installation called PC-10: Panda³, with LED lights mounted in a plexiglass box frame and controlled by an Arduino microcontroller.

## Integrated materials: everything can be "black"
After the 2010s, the wild demo scene became more experimental in its use of media, with enthusiasts using a number of particularly unexpected devices. 2010 saw the German industrial music group Haujobb's Payback use an ATM in a bank as a platform for their work.

In 2013, the famous German presentation party Revision Party started a collaboration with the Experimental Media Lab (xm:lab) of the HBKsaar Institute of Plastic Arts to collect works for the Media Facade for presentation scene enthusiasts.

Similar installations, often referred to as "wave screens" or "naked 3D screens," have become particularly popular in China since 2020, largely due to the new media art boom sparked by the huge marketing effect of the LED screens on the facade of the COEX Mall in South Korea. This is mainly due to the huge marketing effect of the LED screen on the outside wall of COEX shopping center in Korea, which has triggered a new media public art boom in China, and this is already 6~7 years behind the attempt of demo scene.

Revision Party's competition site used a media wall made up of five projectors. We can see that the 2013 works are still relatively crude, with many of them taking on the form of multi-frequency video works. However, the first-place entry "White water" already demonstrated the practice of using the corners in the media wall to create the illusion of three-dimensional space. And in 2016, the related works can already use the characteristics of curtain walls more maturely to create a more spatial effect such as collision and breaking glass.

The "space art" that has been frequently mentioned in the past two years also entered the practice of demo scene enthusiasts as early as 2014, when the work 10 Orbyte put a 10KB demo code of Commodore 64 onto the built-in flash memory of a micro-cube satellite called WREN, which was launched on the UniSat-5 mission. UniSat-5 mission was launched into orbit and will fly in orbit for roughly 20 years.

Another work that received attention in the demo scene in 2014 demonstrated the use of a flip-dot display, and the XAYAX team created the demo Flippin' The Dots using a Raspberry Pi and network-controlled flip-dot based display designed by the Chaos Computer Club Munich eV. The demonstration Flippin' The Dots used a Raspberry Pi and network-controlled dot-matrix magnetic flip display designed by the Chaos Computer Club Munich eV and won first place in the wild demo competition at the Nordlicht 2014 gathering in Bremen.

Projection mapping of physical objects also appeared in the wild demo competition, and in 2014 the Gaspode group created a piece called Light & Magic using an Amiga computer case as a display surface.

Programmable laser shows are new to wild demonstrations in the 2010s, with some enthusiasts experimenting with incorporating old-fashioned hardware into laser shows. The LSR 64 produced by the KETTŐ group is a laser device show using Commodore 64 controls.

And the laser piece reLase, presented at Tokyo Demo Fest 2017, was created by Hector Martin, author of the open source laser graphics framework OpenLase, to demonstrate the framework's capabilities.

Wearable devices, such as the Pebble Time smartwatch, have also become platforms for enthusiasts to create, with the 2016 work Rocky Reality recreating the image effects of the famous 1993 DOS demo Second Reality on the small screen of a smartwatch.

And experimental literature related to old computers has also appeared in competitions for wild demos, with Robbo Solucja (Robbo. Walkthrough, Robbo Raiders), an entry in the 2017 Silly Venture in Poland, written by assistant professor Piotr Marecki of Jagiellonian University in Poland. Piotr Marecki, an assistant professor at Jagiellonian University in Poland. The program is a "Robbo cheat generator" inspired by the popular Polish Atari XL / XE computer game "Robbo".

In 2018, Piotr Marecki edited the 56 game cheats generated by Robbo Solucja into a book with the same title, Robbo. Solucja. Atari, Creative Making & Zombie Computers), details of the Robbo. Solucja software and book production are presented.

Some of the latest display devices were also used by enthusiasts in the demo scene, with HoloGrail, a work made with the volumetric display Voxon VX-1, appearing at the 2021 Revision party.

In reviewing the various "real-time wild" works of the past 20 years, it is easy to see that the boundary between "wild presentations" in the demo scene and new media artworks in the usual sense has become very blurred, and the creators' identification with the culture and values of the demo scene is the reason why they choose to use the demo scene as a platform for their work. The creators' identification with the culture and values of the demo scene is the main reason why they choose to publish their works through demo parties rather than new media art exhibitions.

## Non-Computer Wild Demos
Among the "wild demos" are works that are neither video or animated video works, nor programmed or electronically produced "real-time wild" works, which are closer to mechanical installations or performance art works.

For example, the optical properties of the Overhead Projector OHP, which we covered in the Experimental Archaeology of Digital Media course, are often used by enthusiasts in demonstration scenes to choreograph optical performances.

At the 2008 Buenzli gathering in Winterthur, Switzerland, the cortex group won first place in the wild demonstration competition for their work entitled "Interferenz", which means "interference fringe" in German. The title "Interferenz" means "interference stripes" in German, and this is one of the most common effects of writing projector works. The group has since entered several competitions with their writing projector entries, and their work has been compiled in the Pouet.net database.

At the 2012 @party in Boston, USA, the Desire and TRSI teams also presented their writing projector work: "OHP MEGA DEMO 9000", which featured a number of effects commonly found in real-time generated demos, such as loading progress bars, bouncing colored balls, wave-like subtitles flying across the screen, and so on.

Demo scenes that are completely "unplugged" are less common, but still a category that cannot be ignored. For example, the Outbreak & Darklite group's "Pixel by Pixel" is a work that uses mosaics to reproduce pixel art on bathroom walls. The Danish Underpants Brigade's "Demoscene Battle Cards" is a demonstration of the "celebrities" in the demo scene as game characters in a board game, showing the funnier and more cerebral side of the tech art community.

For the demo scene, the existence of "wild demos" represents the tension and resilience of the community, allowing the demo scene to extend outward from a purely technical computer community, connecting different communities of enthusiasts while sharing their creativity and culture with others, and reaching out to a wide range of creations beyond computers. The boundaries are wide enough to reach a range of creations beyond computers.

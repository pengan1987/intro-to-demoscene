# "New Generation" Chip Music Scene
Hello everyone, today is the ninth lesson in the "Introduction to the Demo Scene" series, and the last lesson on the topic of "Chip Music". In the first two lessons of "Chip Music", we reviewed the origins of chip music 8-bit game music and its development by Demoscene, but today's lesson will focus on the part of chip music outside the game and demo scenes - in particular, the part of chip music that started in the late 90's and has been used since then. Today's session will focus on the part of chip music outside of the game and demo scene - specifically, the chip music community that is neither game music nor outside of Demoscene, as represented by LSDJ and Nanoloop from the mid to late 90s onwards.

## Chip music doesn't always follow the principles of executable in demo scenarios
In mainstream Demoscene practice, the audiovisual effects of demo programs are defined after they are released, and demo programs usually have clear requirements for the computer platform on which they run. A loss in the competition: the program may not work properly at the competition site, or may not run optimally.

But for chip music authors, although they also create executable music programs (Executable Music) and basically follow the rules common to other categories of demo scene competitions, such as restrictions on running platform, playing time, and program capacity. But there is another audience-oriented context for their work, namely live performances. In the chip music scene, some musicians have built their reputation entirely on live performances without experience in producing executable music programs.

The paper's 2013 collection Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance includes Matthias Pasdzierny's paper "Geeks on Stage: (Live Performance) Investigations in the World of (Live) Chip Music" from the University of the Arts Berlin. Investigations in the World of (Live) Chipmusic), which describes in some detail the emergence and development of chip music as a live performance.

In this paper, the author points out that there is a lot of ambiguity in the definition of "chip music" today, especially since the applications of sound chips are not limited to home computers and game consoles, but include toys, telephones, musical instruments, and so on.

> However, as Carlsson himself mentions, such a classification hides new problems, especially in the further separation, for example, since sound chips have been assembled not only in game consoles and home computers, but also in toys, telephones, musical instruments (such as different kinds of electronic keyboards) and various other devices (ibid.).

He therefore focuses the discussion on "scenes" rather than "chips" and points to Demoscene and Tracker as "open source" music production and communication as The key to the formation of the chip music scene: the MOD file holds all the samples used by the music producer and organizes them, arranges their structure, and allows everyone to modify and reuse them.

What makes the > Tracker so attractive to Demoscene is the ability to share music in an open source format. At the end of the composing or arranging process, there is no need to export the music as - to some extent closed - sound files (usually including loss of sound quality), but the music exists (and is distributed) in the form of module files (so-called MODs) that which contain information about all samples and patterns used and remain editable for all in every respect.

## The first generation of chip musicians who took hardware seriously
Overseas researchers largely acknowledge that the chip music "scene" was formed in the Demoscene, and are members of the "first generation" of the chip music scene. They also point out that from the mid to late 1990s onwards, new chip music producers often ceased to be closely associated with the Demoscene, and that the chip music scene gradually separated from the demo scene and became a new scene with its own activities, terminology and cultural symbols.

These new members of the demo scene are known as the "second" and "third" generation of chip music makers. In Geeks on Stage: A Survey of the Chip Music World (Live Performance), the term "second generation" or "new school" is used to describe the newer, more performance-oriented, less technically oriented faction of the chip music scene that emerged around 2000; and in Chip Music, Fakebit and the Chip Scene Chipmusic, Fakebit and the Discourse of Authenticity in the Chipscene" adds a description of the "third generation" of chip musicians who are more culturally rebellious and disregardful of hardware characteristics. " chipmusicians.

Geeks on Stage: (Live Performance) A Survey of the World of Chip Music confirms a point we made at the beginning of this session, namely that chip music in the period when it was born, and therefore born in the demo scene, initially followed a demonstration process of programming and executing demo programs without live performance.

> First, we must note that in the early days of the chip music scene, traditional live performances were not important, or, in fact, did not exist. Instead, programming itself was considered a performance, especially if, as in the demo scene, each person brought his or her computer system to the demo session and publicly polished his or her demo to the last second.
> ......
> In this respect, chiptuners take seriously the independent life of computers, or, as Daniel Botz writes, follow Friedrich Kittler's theory: "[Demonstrations] are not based on shaping purposes that follow an ideal form and are achieved through appropriate computer technology. They are closely tied to the possibilities and limitations of particular hardware in terms of production and reproduction. [......] Ideas do not come first, but machines." (ibid: 29)

The seriousness with which early chip musicians approached hardware was inherited from the Demoscene, which explains the "loyalty" of many chip musicians to specific hardware, their willingness to spend more time and money on collecting and restoring older hardware and sound chips, and their considerable rejection of emulators. The same reasoning underpins the enduring popularity of old computer demos (oldskool demos) and the vintage computing community.

## Second generation chip musicians: embracing the conventions of popular music
The "second generation" or "new school" chip musicians mentioned in Geeks on Stage are probably closer to how we think of chip music today, at least in the sense that many of the software they use is the one that comes up most frequently when we refer to chip music today. At least many of the software they use are the ones that appear most frequently when we refer to chip music today, such as LSDJ and FamiTracker, to name a few. And there are many differences between them and the demo scene, both in terms of community culture and practice characteristics.

> Unlike Demoscene, the so-called "second generation" or "new school" of chip musicians (Dittbrenner 2007: 116, Yabsley 2007: 15), which started around 2000 They were more open to popular music conventions and communities. New Tracker programs, starting with LSDj for the Game Boy, and NES/Famicom trackers such as MCK/MCKC and FamiTracker, made it possible to focus on the possibilities of fiddling with sounds and using computer systems as live performance instruments, not only in their technical context. -This is why some of the participants in the Demoscene created the "Cubase chip musician" joke (Carlsson 2007: 156). Since the emergence of this performance-oriented scene, terminology has also changed. For example, the definition of the concept of "chip music" has been expanded. "Ideally, it would be dance music with square waves. I'd say it's the new millennium (stereo) type of chip music. And purists inevitably mutter ......" (Carlsson 2010: 5) Sometimes the term "fakebit" (instead of 8-bit) appears in this context, defined as the use of 1980s chip music sounds, but produced entirely by ordinary modern samplers, synthesizers and sequencer programs.

From the 1980s to the 1990s, chip music developed a range of software, tools and methods from the Demoscene. However, the most important hallmark of chip music from the late 1990s to around 2000 was the "exodus" from the Demoscene and the incorporation of more pop music features, a period when the chip music scene focused on sound beyond hardware, and an extreme of this attempt was "sound without hardware", as in "sound without hardware". As the name "Cubase chip musicians" describes, "fake chip" musicians used a lot of digital audio workstation (DAW) software for their productions, not necessarily using real sound chips, and often did not understand the importance of the sound. They do not necessarily use real sound chips, and often do not understand the programmable nature of sound chips.

The emergence of "fake chips" among the second generation of chip musicians is probably the most controversial topic in the chip music world today, and the controversy continues to this day, but among the "third generation" of chip musicians, which will be introduced later, "fake chips" are much more common than "fake chips". But among the "third generation" of chip musicians to be introduced later, "Fake Chip" has a higher degree of acceptance than any previous generation of participants.

The core reason why "Cubase chip musicians" are criticized by Demoscene members is not simply a difference in attitude towards hardware or technical background. The conflict between them is actually a conflict of values between the non-commercial ethics promoted by the Demoscene and the compatibility of digital audio software with commercial production.

In "Playing new music with old games: The chiptune subculture", the expletive "Fuck Pro Tools", which is popular in the chip music community, is mentioned to explain the attitude of a significant portion of chip musicians toward digital audio software.

> As we can see in the hacker/punk connotations noted above, chiptune artists tend to present themselves as inherently subversive. From their claimed opposition stance, they ignore the latest technological developments, upgrades, sound and 3D graphics cards. Furthermore, they tend to oppose the idea of "planned obsolescence", which has proven to be one of the best ways to control and manipulate the masses through technology, especially in the digital age. They prefer older computers and gaming equipment to the latest digital audio workstation software. "Fuck Pro Tools," as members of the micromusic online community put it.

## Nanoloop
Among the most influential production tools developed by the "second generation" of chip musicians are Nanoloop and LSDJ. Unlike Tracker, which created and shaped the chip music scene as mentioned in the previous two lessons, Nanoloop and LSDJ were not developed by enthusiasts in the Demoscene. They are considered to be the work of an independent kind of chip music scene that started in the late 90s, and their choice of platform stems from the huge success of the Game Boy in the mass market.

In an interview with the German online electronic music magazine MEMI, Nanoloop author Oliver Wittchow has a clear explanation of his starting point and motivation for developing the software, confirming that Nanoloop emerged as a thesis project for art school students. At the same time Oliver had no programming experience when he started creating Nanoloop, much less being a professional developer.

But Nanoloop didn't just appear out of nowhere; the amateur developer community around the Game Boy had already grown considerably before Nanoloop appeared in 1998, and Oliver explicitly mentions in the interview that the BASIC interpreter and C compiler on the Game Boy were basically available in the state bar around 1996.

In the interview, Oliver also mentioned a series of software synthesizers that inspired Nanoloop, including JavOICe, Generator (Reaktor), and Super Collider.

These three software programs basically covered the various groups of software synthesizer development at the time: JavOICe was a research project by Peter Meijer, a scientist working at Philips at the time, and was developed primarily to provide visual aids for the visually impaired to acoustify the picture; while Generator started as both a software synthesizer for music composition, and in the late 90s used While SuperCollider began as an academic project at Texas State University to develop a programming language for music synthesis, the project was open-sourced in 2002 and has evolved since.

Although Oliver uses software developed by Demoscene, such as Fasttracker, he does not consider his work to be in the "demo scene style" and his reasons for using FastTracker are entirely functional.

> This style can be called Minimal House, or sometimes Ambient or Trip Hop. I really like minimalism, but I'm not really a fan of lo-fi. I use Fasttracker because I've gotten used to it and it's still the fastest way to organize samples for me. This has nothing to do with the "demo scene" style. It also has some features that other programs don't have, especially "sample offset" and fast "instrument remapping".

Also Oliver ruled out any relationship with Nintendo, the developer of the Game Boy, in the interview, including official development tools or access to cassette licensing:.

> Thomas Finegan (TF): Do you have any development tools from Nintendo?

> Oliver Wittchow (OW): No, the Game Boy C compiler is an unofficial product, as is the Basic interpreter. There is a big Game Boy fan community on the Internet. Even real demos, like the ones on the Amiga or Atari ST back in the day. I was able to find all the documentation on the Internet about Game Boy.

> TF: Have you considered getting a license from Nintendo for Nanoloop?

> OW: I think it's too small and special for Nintendo to even bother with it - i.e. they're not interested in licensing it and aren't going to send out lawyers right away.
Nintendo makes almost no profit from the Game Boy itself, and the console is often even subsidized [note: the 100 millionth Game Boy was recently sold], so I understand the licensing thing. It's just the system of this industry. And I'd be happy to license it for Nanoloop, or even sell it altogether. But there's no way I could meet the requirements to be an official Game Boy developer, and it would be almost impossible to contact Nintendo directly, only possibly through a third-party manufacturer.

The emergence of LSDJ is more closely tied to the demo scene than Nanoloop. In a 2012 interview, LSDJ author Johan Kotlinski mentioned that some of his friends were members of the Swedish Hack n' Trade demo group and that they all shared the same interest in Commodore 64 and Amiga music, while he also He also mentions having used Musicline Editor, a music production tool that runs on Amiga computers, which was also developed by Demoscene.

In another interview from 2020, Johan describes the situation more specifically, mentioning another musician, Goto80, who was a member of Hack n' Trade, Anders Carlsson.

> Like many people in Sweden, I grew up with the Commodore 64 and Amiga, so I got used to the sounds early on. in the early 90s I learned Protracker and shared .mod files on the bulletin board system, and made friends on FidoNet who shared my musical tastes; mainly the techno/ house/IDM stuff at the time.
> ......
> In the mid-90s I started using a new Amiga synthesizer program called Musicline Editor. i think it didn't catch on because people were moving to PC and Playstation at this time. but I liked it a lot. Compared to Protracker, it had the potential to create new sounds rather than just using samples. Also, the vertical workflow made it easier for me to finish songs. I made a lot of music, had a lot of fun, and exchanged tapes with several people I found interested in listening.
> In 2000, I printed the 7" vinyl "Papaya EP" using Commodore 64 music made by my friend Goto80. Surprisingly, people liked it enough to sell a thousand copies. I think it inspired us both to put more effort into what we were doing.
> It was around this time that I started making some kind of music program for Game Boy Color, and it turned out to be surprisingly interesting. I named it Little Sound Dj and sold cartridges on the Internet and at a local record store. I found more like-minded people in Stockholm and on the Internet. From there, things kind of exploded thanks to http://micromusic.net和其他早期的互联网社区. Suddenly, a lot of people who thought this music should be treated as "real music" realized they weren't alone and learned how to network and organize gigs. It was recognized as a movement. And it has continued ever since.

In 2009, Johan Kotlinski wrote an article "Amiga Music Programs 1986- 1995" (Amiga Music Programs 1986- 1995) also reflects the author's knowledge of the Commodore 64 and Amiga music programs used by Demoscene.

However, similar to Nanoloop, LSDJ borrows some ideas and techniques from Demoscene, but its developers are not themselves part of the demo production team and its successful performance may not be in line with the need to create demo programs. As Goto80 mentioned, developers in the demo scene usually don't let the music program use all the CPU resources because the demo program needs extra resources to process the graphics, but for chip music developers, their software will use all the CPU resources to process the music.

> @viznut: You are right in many ways. There's a difference between accepting defaults and trying to go beyond them, but chip music is usually about both. For me, most of the good chip music I've found lately isn't made for Demoscene, and to be honest, Demoscene's chip products aren't always technically impressive. Also, chip producers use software that maximizes CPU resources in a way that Demosceners usually don't (I mean LSDj vs Carillon for example) and therefore gain an advantage. (goto80)

Nanoloop and LSDJ are both very popular chip music production software, and there are many video tutorials online, so I won't go into the details of how to do it in this article.

## Why did you choose Game Boy for the chip music scene?
Compared to computer platforms like the Amiga or Commodore 64, the Game Boy was not perfect. The computer system had more flexibility, floppy disks that could be read and written at random were far more convenient and cheaper to use than cassette tapes, the computer's larger screen and keyboard also provided better operational efficiency, and peripherals such as mice and game telepresence could also provide more control.

But why did chip music developers outside the demo scene choose the Game Boy as its primary platform in the late 1990s? This question was also asked in Geeks on Stage: (Live Performance) A Survey of the Chip Music World at.

> But what is it about the Game Boy that has become so popular as an instrument in a very short period of time? I think it's not just about the sound. Other devices, especially the C64, offered more possibilities in this regard. In addition, the emerging Tracker software, such as LSDj and Nanoloop, may have been the trigger rather than the cause of this development, although in this respect, the special live performance capabilities of LSDj in particular opened up entirely new opportunities.
The article categorizes four reasons for the Game Boy's popularity as an instrument, namely accessibility, portability and intuitive usability, pop culture symbols, and physical expression of the player. The first two need no introduction; as a handheld game console that has sold over 100 million copies, the Game Boy is inexpensive, easy to obtain, and very simple to operate. And the latter two are explained in more detail by the author.

> Beyond that, however, it seems to be the Game Boy's status as a pop culture icon known to everyone in the Western world, and the fact that for some generations it has become part of a multi-sensory collective memory, that makes it so appealing. In this regard, Alex Yabsley describes Game Boy as a "symbol that has a lot of semiotics attached to it" and for this reason it could develop into a trademark for the entire field of chip music (Yabsley 2007: 23). A current example is the RTP (Reformat the Planet) DVD merchandising package, which comes with a personalized paper Game Boy.

> But it is not only the look, feel, sound and graphics of the Game Boy that can evoke and convey such meanings and memories, but also the physical expression of the player, or to quote media philosopher Vilém Flusser, the gesture of playing the Game Boy can be interpreted (and staged) in different and even contradictory ways. Referring to Umberto Eco, Yabsley coins the term "semiotic guerrilla warfare" for the experience of someone visiting a Game Boy concert (Yabsley 2007: 23). On the one hand, you see the stereotypical image that most people have of the drained gamer hunched over a console, immersed in his or her "artificial world". On the other hand, the viewer is also presented with the image of a much-appreciated artist, a (rock) musician who represents the authenticity and expressiveness of his or her artistic creativity with (at least sweaty) noble physical movements (Frith 1998: 210-211).

Just as Kraftwerk deconstructed the stereotypical image of rock stars with their suit-clad engineers, so too did the players of Chip Music demonstrate a different kind of human-machine interaction as they held Game Boy and twisted their bodies around the stage.

## Teaching and imitation: wider distribution
In the article "Chip Music, Fakebit, and the Discourse of Authenticity in the Chip Scene," it is mentioned that the second generation of chipsters saw themselves as artists rather than programmers or gamers, while introducing two elements of rapid dissemination for chip music, namely Internet-based distribution and the mobility of performances. Both written tutorials and video materials began to appear on the Internet in the 2000s, while the popularity and ease of portability of Game Boy consoles allowed chip music to appear outside of European countries and in street performances.

The paper also mentions that for second-generation musicians, imitation is the first step in learning to make chip music
> The learning process follows a specific pattern: people need to copy [14] the steps of their mentors in order to learn how to operate the software and then use their own musical ideas.

> Copying - or rather, imitating - became an intrinsic characteristic of the second generation of chip musicians. Among this generation are participants who were initially interested only in creating chip music rather than programming and experimenting with software. Seeing composition as a process of imitation creates an interesting paradox. As Hallam and Ingold (2007, 5) observe, creating a cultural artifact means producing something new that did not exist before. Each creation is tied to a pre-existing ideology. If the result is new, then it is creative according to the initial argument. This logical paradox suggests that anything that is copied or imitated cannot be new, and therefore it is not creative. A possible explanation of this paradox in the context of chip music is as follows. To some extent, the first generation of the chip music scene instinctively tried to avoid this paradox by using original platforms and creating chip music from scratch. However, it seems that the second generation accepted this paradox (again instinctively) by embracing the concept of imitation as part of the creative process [15].

For myself, I have personally experienced such a process of mimicking and then being mimicked. futureSound vol2, which I participated in Beijing in the summer of 2019, was a workshop on chip music production, and its main content, mimicked from the ChipLabs workshop of the Vancouver Chip Music Society.

## Global Music Festival
The second generation of chip musicians mentioned in "Chip Music, Fakebit and the Discourse of Authenticity in the Chip Scene" are also the main drivers of global chip music festivals, and also play a major role in the popularization of chip music to the masses:.

> The second generation of chip musicians is best known for establishing global festivals (e.g. Blip Festival, Eindbaas, Micromusic parties) and also popularizing chip music by sampling its aesthetic features in popular culture (using audio samples in popular music, pixelating images, etc.). In this generation of the chip scene, ICTs are adopted as a method of production and promotion. Crowdsourcing, for example, is a relatively new way of raising funds to support the organization of events in the chip scene as well as music and video releases by soliciting financial support from internet users online. One example is the documentary film "8 Bits of Europe" outlining the European chip scene, whose director, Javier Polo, started a crowdsourcing campaign on Verkami [16], raising more than 5,000 euros.

It should be noted that today's chip music scene is largely defined by the second generation of chip musicians, who redefined the cold and technical definition of the first generation of chip music to make it more compatible with the techno-cultural scene.

The practice of creating "fake chips" with simulator software has been emerging since the second generation of chip musicians, and the most important reason for using fake chips is to circumvent the complexity of real hardware, as mentioned in "Chip Music, Fakebit, and the Discourse of Authenticity in the Chip Scene", where the Canadian software developer Plogue created a fake chip for advertising slogan written by the Canadian software developer Plogue for the synthesizer ChipSounds.

- You can use a standard MIDI controller to start creating chip music.
- You don't need to deal with a small, hard-to-read interface.
- You don't need to learn assembly language, or hexadecimal.
- You don't need to use tracker, although it works fine with tracker.
- You can choose whether to be limited in pitch and polyphony.
- You don't need to spend years collecting collections like this one at garage sales, flea markets or online auctions. We've already done that for you :)

Basically, the emergence of the "fake chip" represents a trend towards more simplified chip music creation.

## Third generation of chip musicians: more loosely defined
The second generation of chip musicians still follows to a considerable extent the purist approach to hardware of the first generation of chip musicians, including the developers of the "fake chip" software, who also emphasize their true rendition of the hardware's characteristics, as mentioned in the ChipSounds ad.

- We own all these chips and have painstakingly sampled and analyzed them.
- We've revisited all known documentation for each chip and verified any technical allegations using our own custom tests.

But for the third generation of Chipsters, the biggest difference between them and the second generation of Chipsters is that they are not concerned with technical limitations and purist standards, but rather combine acoustic instruments as well as computer hardware and software. They are often sometimes referred to as chipsters, or chip hipsters. Their use of chip music is more akin to "vintage" and is motivated more by the expression of culturally anti-mainstream ideas than by technical preferences or achievements.

## "Fakebit" and the gaming community
Chip Music, Fakebit and the Discourse of Authenticity in the Chip Scene also mentions that many fans of "fakebit" come from the gaming community.

> In field research, Roger Cruz, who runs Chip-Con International, emphasized that most people interested in fakebit come from video game communities such as OCRemix (interview, 2013).

> Me: Is OCRemix geared towards the retro community?

> Roger: Yes, but it's just taking old acoustic music and making it more modern. It's not chiptune content, but we have a lot of people from that community, thanks to Chiptunes=Win and DJ Cutman, who came from there. As long as there's some chiptune involved, it's considered chiptune - whether it's fake or not, and the audience doesn't care, but people like pure chips more than the mixed stuff. (Email interview, 2013).

To a certain extent, this also explains the confusion in the understanding of chip music in China today: that is, most "chip music" fans are actually retro game music fans, and when the earliest domestic chip musicians such as Sulimi started to spread chip music in China around 2010, it was already the second to third generation of chip musicians overseas. When Sulimi and other first domestic chip musicians started to spread chip music in China around 2010, it was already the second to third generation of chip musicians in overseas, when retro games like "VVVVVVV" became popular, and also when a large number of nostalgic game fans flocked to the topic of chip music on the Internet. The concept of "chip music" has been associated with games almost from the very beginning. And apart from myself, there is hardly anyone else in China who understands the connection between chip music and the demo scene.

## The stagnation and revival of chip music in Japan
In China, the 8-bit computers that were popular in Europe using PSG were almost never popular, and almost everyone's exposure to chip music was through Japanese consoles, mainly the Red and White and its replicas. As a result there is often a misconception in China that chip music is part of Japanese culture. But as described in the previous three lessons, when the game industry abandoned the use of chip music, almost all of the development around sound chips was done by Europeans throughout the 1990s, and chip music in Japan was almost at a standstill.

In his 2001 summary article, Japanese chip music researcher and VORC.org webmaster Hajime Tanaka (hally) described his impressions of American composer Jake Kaufman's (Virt) album in the following way.

> (the "FX EP" album) is not only excellent in composition, but also succeeds in completely imitating the old Konami style. Perhaps today's Japanese musicians, including Konami, could not have done that. virt could be said to be the only successor of the former Konami. This means that the Japanese chiptune style is dead in Japan, but popular in the US/Europe. So "FX EP" became the turning point of Japanese chiptune.

And Japanese demo scene and chip music researcher, SID Media Lab station director Takashi Kawano (Akabai akaobi) mentioned that in the 90's Japanese Tracker used to make BMS score files for music games, and "MOD" was once mistaken as a synonym for score files. He also mentions that VORC was the first website to introduce the term "chip music" to Japan.
https://akaobi.wordpress.com/2015/07/01/anti-memoirs-an-experience-of-chipmusic-in-japan/

> Once, my brother asked me, "Have you ever heard of MOD?" I didn't know what the term meant at the time, but later learned that it referred to a music file format used in Urao Yane's BM98, released in 1998, a freeware program inspired by Konami's 1997 beatmania release. To be precise, this format is a script called BMS (Be-Music Script or Be-Music Source file), which describes the assignment of objects consisting of wav files and bmp files, so it is quite different from MOD as a music file format. In the BMS scene, the work of making a file is divided into pictures and sounds. This is similar to the division of making a product in Demoscene. In other words, there is a professional concept there. In addition, in Japan in the late 90's, tools originating from Demoscene such as Scream Tracker, Impulse Tracker, FastTracker II, MODPlug Tracker and PlayerPRO were used to produce music in BMS scenes, and also by other PC users. The demo scene is located right next to me. Then in 2001, the Chipmusic website VORC was launched, introducing the term and concept of Chiptune to this country. Ironically, I didn't have a PC back then.

The year 2002 is considered by hally to be "the real beginning of chip music in Japan", and much of that revolved around LSDJ.
http://www.vorc.org/en/columns/hally/2002best10e.html

> Until last year, non-commercial chip music in Japan was almost dead. But since nanoloop started supporting Japanese, a new generation of Japanese chiptune authors has finally emerged. cow'p (19-t) is one of the most successful Gameboy musicians in Japan. His debut album "Africa" is full of hardcore chiptune intelligent dance music. mmfan316 was one of the first nanoloop musicians in Japan and is about to debut from the U.S. K-> is one of the most recent Little Sound Dj users, but brings quite a brush with fresh Konami-style pop. w2X is an unknown robot chip composer using GBC or MSX. hex125's complex funk style is also impressively Hex125's complex funk style is also impressive. He is now managing the Japanese language support page for Little Sound Dj. Also Little Sound Dj added some great features like the LSDj Patcher, which allows you to change sample packs, and KeyboardInterface, which plays Gameboy through a PC keyboard.

In addition, hally also mentioned that the tools around 2002 around the Red and White Machine and NSF music formats promoted the connection between the Japanese and Western music communities. On the one hand, the Red and White Machine MML music compiler mck was accepted by the chip music community outside of Japan at the end of 2001. On the other hand, NerdTracker2, cheestracker and other music editing software that can edit NSF files also entered Japan, bringing many new inspirations to local enthusiasts.

> As with the hardware/software development, the cultural revolution caused by mck is also worth mentioning. Some non-Japanese composers like Virt, Rugar and Nulsleep started using mck. as you know, for Europeans/Americans, the graphical Tracker style has been the standard way to create game/demo music. Therefore, the (for better or worse) simple text-based style called MML in Japan was once not understood. At least most people didn't want to compose in this way. But mck started to melt such an ice wall.

> As a result, Virt translated the mckc manual into English. It was the first MML guide written by a non-Japanese. And nullsleep explained how to use DPCM in mck. Then Rugar released My Girl, Princess LP, the first MML music album compiled by a non-Japanese. Red and White - the common background of both chip music cultures - met the Internet that made us forget our national boundaries. These factors resulted in this unheard-of collaboration.

> On the other hand, music editors for making NSF files have appeared, such as NerdTracker2 (for DOS/Windows, December) and cheestracker (for Linux, January). Now you can choose the way you like. Hopefully this revolution will bring a little change to the rigid Japanese chip musicians who are not yet motivated to create original music.

## Why is there no demo scene in Japan?
It's not hard to understand why Japanese chip music has stagnated. Japan doesn't have a venue like the demo scene to inherit and develop chip music production techniques. But why there is no demo scene in Japan? Japanese game developer, Hiromichi Yoshida (@yosshin4004), the author of Super Connected Shot 68k, summarized it in more detail in "The State of Japan Before the Demo Scene Happened" (デモシーン発生前の日本の狀況), where he argued that the reasons for the lack of a demo scene in Japan were as follows.

- Japanese home video game consoles have become more popular, which has reduced the exposure of Japanese youth to graphics programming
- The pattern of software cracking activities in Japan is different from that of overseas, as cracking activities in Japan are more hidden and no one makes cracking credits to reveal their identity as crackers, which is obviously different from the situation of cracking openly especially compared to Eastern Europe where it is difficult to obtain genuine software.
- Japan lacks a "computer underground" similar to those overseas. Japan has computers and art, but lacks an underground atmosphere to link them.
- Japan's thriving anime culture has "co-opted" individual fans through its strong infrastructure, and the manga market (Comiket) and the homo software market (Pasoket) have made the majority of developers inclined to make games by the role of the market. The PROJECT TEAM DoGA has diverted non-real-time animation and CG works.
- Japan lacks a base of computer game parties similar to LAN Party overseas

From this we can also see that cultural factors are playing a stronger role in the emergence of demo scenes than technical conditions. This is particularly important to consider in our future research into the applicability or inapplicability of certain products, technologies and communities in particular countries.

## Wrap-up
We will find that we are essentially done here for today. In the past three sessions, we have reviewed the developmental origins of chip music, especially the differences between chip music and game music and the connections to the demo scene, and we hope that this session will help you understand and observe the interactions and images between different technological subcultures.
